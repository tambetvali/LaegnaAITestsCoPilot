# Chapter 1 — Intelligent Interactive Interfaces: A Practical Manual and Conceptual Foundation

(in nearby future, you will also get my own basic implementation in snippets - I am still playing with ideas to achieve the "simplest" form)

## Introduction

Modern computers are astonishingly powerful interactive machines. They combine screens, keyboards, mice, touch surfaces, cameras, microphones, and even robotic actuators. Each of these channels allows a user to express intent — pointing, clicking, typing, dragging, selecting, speaking, or showing something visually. Until recently, these signals were interpreted by rigid software systems that required precise commands and predictable workflows.

With the arrival of large language models (LLMs), this relationship changes. Natural language becomes a universal interface layer. Instead of clicking through menus or memorizing commands, users can simply describe what they want. But the real breakthrough comes when **natural language is combined with interactive UI elements** — buttons, inputs, menus, and structured navigation — and the AI is allowed to *use* these elements as part of its reasoning and output.

This chapter explains how to build such an interface using:
- **Flask** as the backend,
- **Backbone.js** for MVC-style real-time updates,
- **Mistune** for streaming markdown-to-HTML conversion,
- **Ollama** for local LLM inference,
- and a **3-level chapter structure** that becomes a dynamic navigation system.

It also explains how this aligns with the ideas in  
[README.md]()  
and how this implementation can serve as a first step toward more advanced interactive conversational systems.

---

## 1. The Power of Human–Computer Interaction + AI

### 1.1. Traditional UI Signals
A user can signal intent through:
- mouse movement and clicks,
- keyboard input,
- scrolling,
- touch gestures,
- selecting items,
- filling forms,
- interacting with buttons,
- and more.

These signals are precise but limited: they require the user to know *where* to click and *what* to do.

### 1.2. Natural Language as a Universal Intent Layer
Natural language allows the user to express:
- goals,
- constraints,
- preferences,
- corrections,
- and high-level tasks.

Instead of navigating menus, the user can simply say:
> “Show me the summary again, but add a section about risks.”

### 1.3. Combining Both Worlds
When UI signals and natural language are combined:
- the AI can interpret user clicks as *events*,
- the AI can generate UI elements (buttons, inputs),
- the user can refine the task through both language and interaction,
- the system becomes more powerful than either modality alone.

This is the core idea behind the Conversation Interactivity README:  
**AI should not only answer questions — it should shape and respond to the interface itself.**

---

## 2. The 3-Level Chapter Structure as an Interactive Navigation System

### 2.1. Level 1 — Top Menu (`# Heading`)
These become the **main sections** of the document.  
The AI uses them to define the high-level structure:
- Overview
- Requirements
- Implementation
- Examples
- Summary

Your frontend extracts `<h1>` elements and builds a **top navigation bar**.

### 2.2. Level 2 — Left Panel (`## Subheading`)
These become **subsections** inside each chapter.  
Your frontend extracts `<h2>` elements and builds a **left-side navigation panel**.

### 2.3. Level 3 — Internal Navigation (`### Sub-subheading`)
These become **anchors** inside each subsection.  
Your frontend can use them to:
- scroll to specific content,
- highlight active sections,
- show context-sensitive controls.

### 2.4. Why This Matters
This structure gives the AI a predictable way to:
- organize its output,
- update only specific sections,
- maintain consistency across revisions,
- and allow the user to navigate a long answer easily.

It also aligns with the README’s idea of **structured conversational documents**.

---

## 3. Buttons, Inputs, and Events: How AI Uses Them

### 3.1. AI-Generated Buttons
The AI can output:
```html
<button data-event="expand-details">Show more details</button>
```

Your frontend listens for clicks and sends:
```json
"events": ["button:expand-details"]
```
back to the AI on the next `/chat` call.

### 3.2. Inputs
The AI can output:
```html
<input type="text" data-input="username" placeholder="Enter your name">
```

Your frontend captures changes and sends:
```json
"events": ["input:username=Alice"]
```

### 3.3. How an Intelligent AI Uses These
A clever AI can:
- open a popup (by generating a new section),
- expand a subsection,
- rewrite only the affected chapter,
- update the summary,
- or add a new item at the bottom.

This is exactly the “interactive conversational document” described in the README.

---

## 4. The Summary: Memory and Inertia

### 4.1. First Generation
The AI produces:
- a short general summary,
- a list of chapters,
- key decisions.

### 4.2. Hidden Memory
Your backend stores this summary and sends it back on every `/chat` call:
```json
"summary": "Previous summary text..."
```

### 4.3. Inertia
Because the AI sees the summary every time:
- it tends to preserve structure,
- it updates only what changed,
- it avoids rewriting everything,
- it maintains continuity.

This creates a **document-like experience** rather than a chat-like one.

---

## 5. Mistune and HTML Interactivity

### 5.1. Can Mistune Show AI-Generated HTML?
Yes.  
Mistune passes through:
- `<button>`
- `<input>`
- `<div>`
- `<span>`
- `<script>` (if allowed — usually disabled for safety)

So the AI can generate interactive HTML without modifying Mistune.

### 5.2. Real-Time Rendering
Your backend streams markdown → Mistune converts chunks → frontend updates DOM.

### 5.3. Cost of Adding More Interactions
Very low:
- AI just outputs more HTML,
- frontend listens for more events,
- backend adds them to the hidden context.

No changes to Mistune are required.

---

## 6. Updating the User’s Question and Showing the Latest Part

### 6.1. Updating the Question
When the user clicks a button:
- the event is added to `eventsLog`,
- the next AI call includes:
  - the original question,
  - the summary,
  - the events.

The AI can reinterpret the question based on these signals.

### 6.2. Showing the Latest Part at the Bottom
The AI can be instructed to:
- append new content at the bottom,
- or update a specific chapter.

Your frontend simply scrolls to the bottom after each update.

---

## 7. How Much Customization Does the AI Need?

### 7.1. Minimal
Just a strong system prompt:
- explain the 3-level structure,
- explain buttons and events,
- explain the summary,
- explain partial updates.

### 7.2. Moderate
Add:
- examples of interactive output,
- examples of partial updates.

### 7.3. Advanced
Introduce:
- tool-calling,
- file editing,
- multi-step workflows,
- persistent memory.

This aligns with the README’s vision of **AI-driven interfaces that evolve with the user**.

---

## 8. Practical Use Cases

### 8.1. Documentation Assistants
AI generates structured documents with interactive navigation.

### 8.2. Configuration Wizards
Buttons and inputs guide the user through multi-step tasks.

### 8.3. Educational Tools
Chapters become lessons; buttons reveal exercises or hints.

### 8.4. Creative Writing
AI maintains a story outline (summary) and updates sections on demand.

### 8.5. Software Architecture Assistants
AI maintains a multi-level design document and updates modules independently.

---

## Summary

This chapter introduced a powerful idea:  
**AI-generated interactive documents** that combine natural language, structured navigation, and UI events.

You learned:
- how the 3-level chapter structure becomes a navigation system,
- how buttons and inputs become event triggers,
- how summaries create memory and inertia,
- how Mistune can stream HTML without modification,
- how the AI can update only parts of the document,
- and how this aligns with the Conversation Interactivity README.

This is a practical first step toward more advanced interactive conversational systems — systems where the AI not only answers questions but *shapes the interface itself*, creating a new kind of human–computer collaboration.

# Chapter 2 — A Multi‑Pane, AI‑Driven Interactive Document Interface

## Overview

Imagine an interface where an AI doesn’t just answer questions but actively **shapes the structure of the screen**, creates **interactive elements**, and updates content in a way that feels closer to a living document than a static chat. This chapter explains such an interface: a system where the AI uses a three‑level chapter hierarchy to control the layout, adds buttons and inputs to guide interaction, and maintains a dynamic area for updates and alerts. The result is a flexible, expressive environment that can serve many different applications — from documentation assistants to configuration wizards, creative tools, or educational systems.

This interface is not a fantasy. It is a natural extension of how modern LLMs behave when given structure, memory, and the ability to generate HTML‑compatible output. The AI becomes a kind of “document director,” orchestrating menus, navigation, and content updates while the user interacts through both language and UI elements.

---

## 1. Three Levels of Chapters as the Structural Backbone

### 1.1. Top Pane — Level 1 Chapters (`# Heading`)
The first level of chapters defines the **top navigation bar**.  
Each `# Heading` becomes a major section of the document, such as:

- Overview  
- Requirements  
- Steps  
- Results  
- Summary  

The AI uses these headings to organize its answer into meaningful, high‑level categories. The user can click these items to jump between sections, and the AI can update them independently when needed.

### 1.2. Left Pane — Level 2 Chapters (`## Subheading`)
Second‑level chapters populate the **left sidebar**.  
These represent subsections inside each major chapter, such as:

- “Installation”
- “Configuration”
- “Troubleshooting”
- “Examples”

This gives the user a clear map of the content and allows the AI to update only the relevant subsection when responding to a button click or input change.

### 1.3. Right Pane — Level 3 Chapters (`### Sub‑subheading`)
Third‑level chapters define **internal navigation** within a subsection.  
These can be:

- anchors,
- expandable details,
- step‑by‑step instructions,
- or fine‑grained content blocks.

The AI can highlight them, scroll to them, or rewrite them without touching the rest of the document.

---

## 2. A Dynamic Update Area for Alerts and Changes

Below the main panes, the interface includes a **scrolling update area**.  
This area shows:

- newly added content,
- changes triggered by user actions,
- warnings or confirmations,
- or incremental updates the AI wants the user to notice.

This keeps the user aware of what changed without forcing them to hunt through the document. It also gives the AI a place to “speak” in a more conversational tone while keeping the main document clean and structured.

---

## 3. AI‑Generated Inputs, Buttons, and Named Content Areas

### 3.1. Buttons and Triggers
The AI can generate HTML elements such as:

```html
<button data-event="expand-details">Show more</button>
```

When the user clicks such a button, the frontend sends an event back to the AI.  
The AI can then:

- expand a section,
- rewrite a subsection,
- open a popup,
- or add a new chapter.

### 3.2. Inputs and User‑Editable Fields
The AI can also create:

```html
<input type="text" data-input="username" placeholder="Enter your name">
```

When the user types into this field, the AI receives the updated value and can:

- personalize content,
- adjust recommendations,
- or update a configuration section.

### 3.3. Named Content Areas
Not everything needs to be a chapter.  
The AI can define named areas such as:

```html
<div data-area="settings-summary"></div>
```

Later, it can update only that area without touching the rest of the document.  
This allows the AI to maintain a stable layout while dynamically rewriting specific parts.

---

## 4. Highlighting, Scrolling, and Page Changes

Because the AI controls the structure, it can also instruct the interface to:

- highlight a specific section,
- scroll to a particular chapter,
- collapse or expand subsections,
- or even create new pages or tabs.

For example, after a button click, the AI might respond:

> “Scroll to the ‘Advanced Options’ section and highlight the ‘Security Settings’ subsection.”

The frontend interprets this instruction and performs the action.

---

## 5. How a Creative AI Uses This Interface

### 5.1. As a Documentation Assistant
The AI can maintain a multi‑chapter document, update sections independently, and guide the user through complex topics with interactive elements.

### 5.2. As a Configuration Wizard
Buttons and inputs allow the AI to walk the user through multi‑step processes:

- choosing options,
- validating inputs,
- generating summaries,
- and updating only the relevant parts.

### 5.3. As a Teaching Tool
The AI can:

- reveal hints,
- show exercises,
- expand explanations,
- or add new chapters as the user progresses.

### 5.4. As a Creative Partner
The AI can:

- generate story outlines,
- let the user expand characters or scenes,
- add new chapters,
- or rewrite specific parts based on feedback.

### 5.5. As a Planning or Decision‑Making Assistant
The AI can:

- maintain a structured plan,
- update sections based on user choices,
- add new branches,
- or highlight important decisions.

---

## 6. Why This Interface Is Powerful

This interface gives the AI **more expressive power** than a chat window:

- It can structure information visually.
- It can guide the user through complex tasks.
- It can maintain memory through summaries and named areas.
- It can update only what changed.
- It can use UI elements to gather precise signals.
- It can create a hybrid of document + application + conversation.

For the user, this means:
- less scrolling,
- clearer navigation,
- more control,
- and a more intuitive experience.

For the AI, it means:
- more context,
- more control over presentation,
- and the ability to create richer interactions.

---

## Summary

This interface transforms the AI from a passive responder into an active designer of the user’s experience.  
By using a three‑level chapter structure, dynamic update areas, and AI‑generated interactive elements, the system becomes a flexible, expressive environment suitable for documentation, teaching, planning, configuration, creativity, and more.

The AI can highlight, scroll, update, or expand content; add new sections; or rewrite specific parts — all while maintaining a stable structure through summaries and named areas. This creates a powerful synergy between natural language and interactive UI, enabling applications far beyond traditional chat systems.

# Chapter 3 — ideas for simple implementation based on [LaegnaAIExperiments/SnippetsCode/Snippet1Editor](https://github.com/tambetvali/LaegnaAIExperiments/tree/main/SnippetsCode/Snippet1Editor)

## 1. Ollama connector recap (what it does)

This is the connector to Ollama client - if you install Ollama locally, you can test the app on small models:

```python
import json
from ollama import Client

client = Client(host="http://localhost:11434")

models = client.list()

print("Installed Ollama models:")
for m in models.get("models", []):
    print("-", m["model"])

# ------------------------------------------------------------
# JSON CONFIGURATION (stored as a string)
# ------------------------------------------------------------
config_json = """
{
  "model": "llama3.2:1b",
  "system_prompt": "You are a helpful AI assistant.",
  "host": "http://localhost:11434",
  "stream": true
}
"""

# ------------------------------------------------------------
# STREAMING OLLAMA CLIENT CLASS
# ------------------------------------------------------------
class OllamaStreamer:
    def __init__(self, config_json: str):
        cfg = json.loads(config_json)

        self.model = cfg["model"]
        self.system_prompt = cfg.get("system_prompt", "")
        self.host = cfg.get("host", "http://localhost:11434")
        self.stream = cfg.get("stream", True)

        # Connect to local Ollama server
        self.client = Client(host=self.host)

    def ask(self, question: str):
        """
        Streams the model's response using Python `yield`.
        Each yield returns a substring (token or chunk).
        """
        messages = []

        # Add system prompt if present
        if self.system_prompt:
            messages.append({"role": "system", "content": self.system_prompt})

        # Add user question
        messages.append({"role": "user", "content": question})

        # Stream the response
        for chunk in self.client.chat(
            model=self.model,
            messages=messages,
            stream=self.stream
        ):
            if "message" in chunk and "content" in chunk["message"]:
                yield chunk["message"]["content"]

# ------------------------------------------------------------
# EXAMPLE USAGE (Q&A)
# ------------------------------------------------------------
if __name__ == "__main__":
    streamer = OllamaStreamer(config_json)

    question = "Explain quantum entanglement in simple terms."

    print("Q:", question)
    print("A: ", end="", flush=True)

    # Stream the answer chunk-by-chunk
    for part in streamer.ask(question):
        print(part, end="", flush=True)

    print()  # final newline
```

**What it does:**

- Lists installed Ollama models.  
- Defines a `config_json` with model, system prompt, host, streaming flag.  
- `OllamaStreamer.ask()` yields chunks of text as they arrive from the model.  
- The example at the bottom prints a streaming answer in the terminal.

We’ll reuse `OllamaStreamer` inside Flask and feed its chunks into **mistune** and then into the browser.

---

## 2. Flask backend: adding an AI Q&A entry point with streaming

You already have `app.py` in `Snippet1Editor` (see `STRUCTURE.md` in your repo:  
`https://github.com/tambetvali/LaegnaAIExperiments/tree/main/SnippetsCode/Snippet1Editor`).

We’ll extend it:

1. **Add a “rich” system prompt** that tells the AI to:
   - Answer in markdown that mistune can convert to HTML.  
   - Use headings as navigation structure:
     - `#` → top menu items  
     - `##` → left panel sections  
     - `###` → internal navigation anchors  
   - Insert buttons/inputs as HTML (e.g. `<button data-event="...">`).

2. **Add a `/chat` route** that:
   - Accepts a JSON payload: `{ "question": "...", "events": [...], "summary": "..." }`.  
   - Builds a hidden task from these (system + summary + events).  
   - Streams the AI’s markdown answer chunk-by-chunk.  
   - Uses mistune to convert markdown to HTML in small pieces.

### 2.1. Updating the system prompt

In `config_json`, change `system_prompt` to something like:

```python
config_json = """
{
  "model": "llama3.2:1b",
  "system_prompt": "You are an AI that answers in markdown which will be rendered to HTML. Use the following structure: top-level headings (#) define main menu items, second-level headings (##) define left panel sections, and third-level headings (###) define internal navigation anchors. You may include HTML buttons and inputs (e.g. <button data-event=\\"event-id\\">Label</button>) that will be wired to events. Always start with a short general summary section that lists all chapters and key decisions. When the user changes inputs or clicks buttons, you will receive an updated event list and summary and must update only the relevant parts if possible.",
  "host": "http://localhost:11434",
  "stream": true
}
"""
```

This is your **hidden contract**: the AI is told to produce structured markdown/HTML that your frontend can interpret as menus and interactive elements.

---

### 2.2. Mistune piece-by-piece: streaming HTML with hooks

Mistune itself is synchronous, but you can **simulate streaming** by:

- Buffering incoming markdown chunks from Ollama.  
- Splitting on “safe” boundaries (e.g. double newlines or headings).  
- Rendering each block with `markdown_parser` and yielding HTML fragments.

Example helper in `app.py`:

```python
import mistune

markdown_parser = mistune.create_markdown()

def stream_markdown_to_html(markdown_chunks):
    buffer = ""
    for chunk in markdown_chunks:
        buffer += chunk

        # Simple heuristic: whenever we see two newlines, render that block
        while "\n\n" in buffer:
            block, buffer = buffer.split("\n\n", 1)
            if block.strip():
                html_piece = markdown_parser(block + "\n\n")
                yield html_piece

    # Render any remaining content
    if buffer.strip():
        yield markdown_parser(buffer)
```

Now we can connect `OllamaStreamer.ask()` → `stream_markdown_to_html()` → Flask streaming response.

---

### 2.3. Flask `/chat` route with streaming response

Add this to `app.py`:

```python
from flask import Flask, request, Response, render_template, jsonify
from ollama import Client
import json
import mistune

app = Flask(__name__)

markdown_parser = mistune.create_markdown()

# Reuse the same config_json and OllamaStreamer from above
# (import or paste them into this file)

streamer = OllamaStreamer(config_json)

def stream_markdown_to_html(markdown_chunks):
    buffer = ""
    for chunk in markdown_chunks:
        buffer += chunk
        while "\n\n" in buffer:
            block, buffer = buffer.split("\n\n", 1)
            if block.strip():
                html_piece = markdown_parser(block + "\n\n")
                yield html_piece
    if buffer.strip():
        yield markdown_parser(buffer)

@app.route("/chat", methods=["POST"])
def chat():
    data = request.get_json(force=True)
    user_question = data.get("question", "").strip()
    events = data.get("events", [])
    summary = data.get("summary", "")

    # Build hidden task context
    hidden_context = ""
    if summary:
        hidden_context += "Current summary of decisions and structure:\n" + summary + "\n\n"
    if events:
        hidden_context += "Recent UI events (buttons/inputs):\n"
        for e in events:
            hidden_context += f"- {e}\n"
        hidden_context += "\n"

    # Combine hidden context + user question into one prompt
    full_question = hidden_context + "User question:\n" + user_question

    def generate():
        markdown_stream = streamer.ask(full_question)
        for html_piece in stream_markdown_to_html(markdown_stream):
            # Send each HTML fragment as a chunk
            yield html_piece

    return Response(generate(), mimetype="text/html")
```

**What this does:**

- Accepts a single logical question plus hidden `summary` and `events`.  
- Feeds them into the AI as context.  
- Streams markdown from Ollama.  
- Converts markdown to HTML piece-by-piece with mistune.  
- Streams HTML fragments to the browser.

---

## 3. Frontend: Backbone.js + TipTap + real-time AI output

You already have `frontend/main.js` with:

- TipTap editor as WYSIWYG.  
- A `#submit-button` that sends markdown to `/parse`.  
- Left/right panes for markdown and rendered HTML.

We’ll:

1. Add a **Q&A form** (question input + “Ask AI” button).  
2. Add a **streaming fetch** to `/chat`.  
3. Parse headings in the returned HTML to build:
   - top menu (from `<h1>`)  
   - left panel (from `<h2>`)  
   - internal navigation (from `<h3>`).  
4. Attach click handlers to `<button data-event="...">` elements.  
5. Maintain a small `events` array and `summary` string in the Backbone view.

### 3.1. HTML changes (in `templates/index.html`)

Inside your main layout (where `#app-container` lives), add:

```html
<div id="qa-container">
  <input id="qa-question" type="text" placeholder="Ask a question..." />
  <button id="qa-submit">Ask AI</button>
</div>

<div id="menu-top"></div>
<div id="menu-left"></div>

<div id="rendered-output"></div>
```

You already load `static/js/assets/main.js` and call `initApp()` as in `STRUCTURE.md`.

---

### 3.2. Extending `frontend/main.js`

We’ll add:

- State: `this.events = []`, `this.summary = ""`.  
- A handler for `#qa-submit`.  
- A streaming fetch to `/chat`.  
- A function to rebuild menus from headings.  
- A function to capture button clicks and push events.

```js
export function initApp() {
  const AppView = Backbone.View.extend({
    el: '#app-container',

    events: {
      'click #submit-button': 'onSubmit',
      'click #qa-submit': 'onAskAI',
      'click #rendered-output button[data-event]': 'onEventClick',
    },

    initialize: function () {
      this.editor = createEditor('#editor', window.INITIAL_HTML)
      this.eventsLog = []
      this.summary = ''
      this.localRender()
    },

    getMarkdown: function () {
      const html = this.editor.getHTML()
      return htmlToMarkdown(html)
    },

    setMarkdown: function (markdown) {
      this.editor.commands.setContent(markdown)
    },

    onSubmit: function () {
      const html = this.editor.getHTML()
      const markdown = this.getMarkdown()

      const payload = { html, markdown }
      const self = this

      $.ajax({
        url: '/parse',
        method: 'POST',
        contentType: 'application/json',
        data: JSON.stringify(payload),
        success: function (response) {
          self.updateRightPane(response.html)
          self.updateMarkdownPane(response.highlighted_markdown)
          self.syncHeights()
        },
      })
    },

    onAskAI: async function () {
      const question = $('#qa-question').val().trim()
      if (!question) return

      const payload = {
        question,
        events: this.eventsLog,
        summary: this.summary,
      }

      // Clear current output
      $('#rendered-output').html('')

      const response = await fetch('/chat', {
        method: 'POST',
        headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
        body: JSON.stringify(payload),
      })

      const reader = response.body.getReader()
      const decoder = new TextDecoder('utf-8')
      let done = false
      let accumulatedHtml = ''

      while (!done) {
        const { value, done: readerDone } = await reader.read()
        done = readerDone
        if (value) {
          const chunk = decoder.decode(value, { stream: true })
          accumulatedHtml += chunk
          $('#rendered-output').append(chunk)
          this.buildMenusFromHtml(accumulatedHtml)
        }
      }

      // After full answer, update summary from the first section
      this.summary = this.extractSummaryFromHtml(accumulatedHtml)
    },

**What this gives you:**

- A **Q&A entry form** (`#qa-question`, `#qa-submit`) that talks to `/chat`.  
- Real-time streaming of HTML from the AI into `#rendered-output`.  
- Automatic menu building from headings.  
- Event logging from AI-generated buttons (`data-event="..."`).  
- A `summary` that is updated after each full answer and sent back as hidden context.

## 4. Mistune + AI-generated HTML: buttons, menus, navigation

Because the AI is instructed to output **markdown + inline HTML**, mistune will:

- Convert headings to `<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<h3>` → used for menus.  
- Pass through `<button>` and `<input>` tags unchanged → used for events.  

Your system prompt already tells the AI:

- How to structure chapters and menus.  
- That it can use `<button data-event="...">` to create interactive elements.  
- That there is a “short general summary” at the top that must always exist and be updated.

The **hidden task** is:

- System prompt (structure + behavior).  
- `summary` (current global decisions).  
- `events` (recent user interactions).  

The AI uses these to:

- Decide whether to rewrite everything or only a part.  
- Update specific sections when a button is clicked.  
- Keep menus and chapters consistent.

## 5. Putting it all together: a simple but not stupid interactive app

With these pieces:

- **Flask** serves:
  - `/` → TipTap editor + Q&A UI.  
  - `/parse` → markdown preview (existing).  
  - `/chat` → AI streaming endpoint using Ollama + mistune.

- **OllamaStreamer**:
  - Streams markdown from a local model.  
  - Uses a rich system prompt to enforce structure and interactivity.

- **Mistune**:
  - Converts markdown to HTML in small chunks.  
  - Allows inline HTML for buttons and inputs.

- **Backbone.js + TipTap**:
  - Provide a WYSIWYG editor (if you want user-authored markdown).  
  - Provide a Q&A form that streams AI answers.  
  - Build menus from headings.  
  - Capture button events and feed them back as hidden `events`.

This gives you a **single-question, multi-event, AI-driven interface** where:

- The AI defines the document structure (chapters, menus, navigation).  
- The user interacts via buttons/inputs generated by the AI.  
- Each interaction becomes an event that is folded back into the next AI call.  
- The AI can update the whole document or just parts, based on the hidden summary and events.

You’ve effectively turned the original TipTap–Flask markdown workbench into a **live AI document engine** with structured navigation and interactive behavior, using only:

- Flask routes  
- Ollama streaming  
- mistune rendering  
- Backbone.js + TipTap on the frontend  
- A carefully designed system prompt and hidden context.
