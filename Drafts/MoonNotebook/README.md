# Moon Notebook

https://jupyter.org/ is the well-known Jupyter Notebook, also used in Google CoLab and other experiment and toolchain systems.

As a programmer, strong advocate of simple formats such as UTF-8 and Markdown for text editing (or ASCII in the past, rather than RTF or painting text to paint images), I see the Jupyter format complex and hard to read.

Jupyter is Json, which is known for:
- Being extremely simple to parse for programmers, as freeform data structure; it's an automatic analogous to Markdown, which has freeform data for users, in form of chapters and paragraphs, not variables and lists.

I do not support using Json types in our tradeoff:
- Json for AI card input
- Json for Notebooks
- Json for even containing our threads and blogs

Json *is* kind of human-readable, as it's also ASCII or UTF-8 based, rather than binary format which also uses underlying number-encoding in addition overlying to letter-encoding. I am sure we can produce JSON, for example, as last input for AI fine-tuner, but I do not think it's better than specialized, strict-standard filetype such as Anki, and the Markdown files which let the cards to be generated. File typing very strongly influences our process and it's understandability and ability to cooperate, altough it's psychological influence is hard to explain: rather we see programs, tools and data than bites and bits and floats and paddings inside, in each case where we choose a tool.

## My idea

Markdown, essentially *already looks like a Notebook* and this is what we should utilize:
- It supports code blocks
- It supports meaningful text in between of code blocks

Moon notebook is thus, a Markdown format, which would apply interpreters or other code-runners to work on our document, and it does so:
- Assigns one console block after each well-known code block.
- Sees the code blocks (optional) as parts of the same program.
- Perhaps, information might still be fed to code blocks before.

It might garbage you a little with an autogenerated cache: past outputs, whether the blocks have been ran or are part of the flow; internals could be stored here.

It might have also this view: an automation, where *opening your file^ itself means that you won't edit it, but it will be displayed, and all the code blocks executed in order unless the language is not known by it's interpreter and output format.

You can extend the code blocks to read variables, GET/POST or input fields you can put into Markdown: probably, a single extension would connect to browser, it's server or current session.

## Name explanation

Jupyter Notebook is very tough, already complex system, which is even hard to duplicate.

Moonlight Notebook is almost what you would *already like to do with Markdown files*, and it has so small specification that it's rather like moonlight, also easy to remember as some kind of opposition or paraphrasing of Jupyter Notebook:
- CoPilot explanation of symbolic words: In Roman mythology, Jupiter represents supreme authority, cosmic order, and expansive power — the sky‑father who governs lightning, law, and the hierarchy of gods — while the Moon symbolizes intuition, cycles, emotion, and the hidden or inner world. Symbolically, Jupiter is outward‑facing, masculine, and expansive (growth, justice, ambition), whereas the Moon is inward‑facing, feminine, and reflective (memory, rhythm, subconscious). Together they form a classic polarity: Jupiter stands for the grand structures that organize life, and the Moon stands for the shifting inner tides that shape personal experience, making their contrast a balance between cosmic order and human feeling.

# Extended Manual and Popular Explanation

Below is a longer, more accessible explanation answering the questions most readers will have.

## Why do we need a simpler notebook?

Most people want a notebook that:
- 🧪 runs code  
- 📘 explains concepts  
- 📤 shows output  
- 🔁 updates quickly  
- 🧠 works with AI  
- 🗂️ is easy to store and share  

Jupyter does all of this — but at the cost of complexity.

Moon Notebook does the same using **only Markdown**, which is:
- readable  
- writable  
- UTF‑8 expressive  
- diff‑friendly  
- future‑proof  

## What does a Moon Notebook look like?

A Moon Notebook is just Markdown with executable code blocks.

Example (escaped):

````markdown
# Example

```python
x = 2 + 2
x
```

```output
4
```
````

This is readable even without tools.

## How does execution work?

- All code blocks of the same language share a session  
- After each code block, an output block is inserted  
- A cache folder stores large outputs  
- Opening the file in “run mode” executes everything  

## How does it compare to Jupyter?

| Feature | Jupyter | Moon Notebook |
|--------|---------|----------------|
| Format | JSON | Markdown |
| Readability | Low | High |
| Git diffs | Noisy | Clean |
| AI friendliness | Medium | Very high |
| Metadata | Heavy | Minimal |
| Editing | Requires UI | Any editor |
| Philosophy | Complex, powerful | Simple, durable |

## Does it support multiple languages?

Yes. Each block declares its language:

````markdown
```python
print("Hello")
```

```javascript
console.log("Hello")
```
````

## What about security?

Modes:
- **trusted** — full execution  
- **sandbox** — restricted  
- **no‑exec** — safe viewing  

## Why the name “Moon Notebook”?

Jupyter = Jupiter = cosmic order, hierarchy, power  
Moon = intuition, cycles, simplicity, reflection  

Moon Notebook is:
- lighter  
- simpler  
- more intuitive  
- more human‑readable  

A gentle alternative to Jupyter.

## Who is this for?

- Developers  
- AI researchers  
- Educators  
- Writers  
- People who dislike JSON notebooks  
- Anyone who wants long‑term readable archives  

## Final thoughts

Moon Notebook is a philosophy:
- **Text first**  
- **UTF‑8 expressive**  
- **Markdown everywhere**  
- **Minimal metadata**  
- **Human‑readable forever**  

It embraces the idea that the simplest formats are often the most powerful.
