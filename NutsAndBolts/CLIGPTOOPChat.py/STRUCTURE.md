# Multi‑Backend CLI AI Chat Workbench — **STRUCTURE.md**

This file defines the entire project structure so an AI or developer can reconstruct the project from scratch.  
It includes: intent, installation, folder layout, workflow, and placeholders for all project files.

To start CoPilot or ChatGPT session for discussing this project, please copy-paste the whole markdown of this
file (Code view) to that chat session as one block so that the AI does not have to scan the folder. The AI
should be instantly capable to discuss the project and create a follow-up plan with you to merge it into your
projects and ideas.

## 1. Purpose of This Document

This project is a **lightweight, backend‑agnostic AI chat workbench**.  
It allows you to:

- Select a model from multiple providers (Ollama, LiteLLM, LitGPT)
- Stream responses token‑by‑token
- Maintain conversation history through a shared OOP abstraction
- Swap backends without changing your application code
- Extend the simple `chat.py` into a full CLI chat loop

This document is the **canonical definition** of the project.

---

## 2. Project Overview

The system consists of:

- **`chat.py`** — minimal demonstration client  
- **`modelselector.py`** — curses‑based selector that writes `model_select.json`
- **`models_config.json`** — list of available models (user‑editable)
- **`Services/`** — backend drivers implementing a shared `AIService` interface  
  - `ollama_streamer.py`
  - `litellm_streamer.py`
  - `litgpt_streamer.py`
- **Session history** — handled by `AIService`, shared across all backends

Workflow:

1. Configure models (`models_config.json`)
2. Select one (`modelselector.py`)
3. Run a backend driver to test it
4. Run `chat.py` to test session history

## 4. Installation & Driver Setup

### 4.1 Python Environment

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate     # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
```

---

## 4.2 Requirements & Driver‑Specific Dependencies

Below is an example `requirements.txt` that includes **all three drivers**, each annotated with an arrow showing **which subsection (4.2.x)** explains when to include it.

```text
ollama    ← 4.2.1  (add this line if using the Ollama driver)
litellm   ← 4.2.2  (add this line if using the LiteLLM driver)
litgpt    ← 4.2.3  (add this line if using the LitGPT driver)
```

You may remove any line if you do not intend to use that driver.

---

### 4.2.1 Ollama Driver

- Python dependency: **`ollama`**  
- Requires **Ollama server** installed separately  
- Models downloaded on first use (hundreds of MB to several GB)  
- Only needed if using local Ollama models  

---

### 4.2.2 LiteLLM Driver

- Python dependency: **`litellm`**  
- Can proxy to OpenAI‑compatible APIs or Ollama HTTP endpoints  
- Lightweight install  
- Only needed if using LiteLLM as a driver  

---

### 4.2.3 LitGPT Driver

- Python dependency: **`litgpt`**  
- Loads local HF‑style models (large downloads)  
- Only needed if using LitGPT models  

---

## 4.3 Testing a Driver

1. Edit or generate `models_config.json`
2. Run the selector:

```bash
python modelselector.py
```

3. Run the backend driver:

```bash
python Services/ollama_streamer.py
python Services/litellm_streamer.py
python Services/litgpt_streamer.py
```

4. Run `chat.py` to test session history:

```bash
python chat.py
```

If the backend supports history, the second answer will reference the first question.

## 5. Project Files — User Files in Root Folder

### 5.1 `chat.py`

**Summary:** Minimal demonstration client showing streaming and session history.

```python
# Before running this script:
# - Run modelselector to select a model from your configured list.
# - If you can not set up configured list, but have ollama running, run ollamaautomodelsjsonconf.py
#   to get a config file list template.
#
# This keeps this script rather simple to understand: basically, you can setup your model manually
# with model_select.json, which would be overwritten if you use model lists:
#
# Here is an example selection of model:
# {
#   "localname": "Run with Litellm", // convenient name for this instance
#   "provider": "ollama", // server type
#   "internalprovider": "litellm", // basically driver
#   "model": "llama3.2:1b", // model type
#   "host": "http://localhost:11434" // server / provider url
# }

from Services.service import AIService, initAIService
from Services.filename import filename
import json

# ------------------------------------------------------------
# JSON CONFIGURATION (stored in a json configuration file)
# ------------------------------------------------------------
with open(filename("model_select.json"), 'r') as file:
    config_json = json.load(file)

streamer = initAIService(config_json)

question = "I am a person who is sitting here."

print("Q:", question)
print("A: ", end="", flush=True)

streamer = streamer.ask(question)

for a in streamer():
    print(a, end="", flush=True)

print()  # final newline

question = "Who is the person who is sitting here?"

print("Q:", question)
print("A: ", end="", flush=True)

streamer = streamer.ask(question)

for a in streamer():
    print(a, end="", flush=True)

print()  # final newline
```

### 5.2 `models_config.example.json`

**Summary:** Example multi‑backend model list.

```json
{
    "models": [
        {
            "localname": "Run with Ollama",
            "provider": "ollama",
            "internalprovider": "ollama",
            "model": "llama3.2:1b",
            "host": "http://localhost:11434",
            "stream": true
        },

            "stream": true
        }
    ]
}
```

### 5.3 `modelselector.py`

**Summary:** Curses‑based selector that writes `add:model_select.json`.

```python
# This is a simple command line client, which will pull the dependencies and run the model.
#   Remove model from configuration file if you do not want to pull it, i.e. while ollama or litellm,
#   accidentially.

# This whole interface is used only to update model_select.json, which automatically contains conf.
# of the single model you selected. You could install framework based on that. Other file,
# models_config.json, is simpler to edit manually as it won't be changed automatically.
# You can add your autogenerated list of models to models_config.json, and additional script
# running before this one could collect your avaiable models of your providers; litellm likely
# supports your provider: an OpenAI compatible AI system.

            # Internalprovider is the different Python wramework we use to access the same model.
            #   it can be ollama or litegpt while provider service is still ollama, whych can be accessed
            #   even directly as requests; TODO: consider implement raw access with requests as internalprovider.

    # If no model is selected, run the model selection menu
    curses.wrapper(main)

"""
### Explanation:

1. **curses Initialization**: The script initializes the `curses` library 
to handle terminal input and output.
2. **Color Pairing**: Two color pairs are defined using 
`curses.init_pair()`. One pair for selected items (red background, yellow 
text) and another for unselected items (white bold text).
3. **draw_menu Function**: This function draws the menu on the screen. It 
iterates over the configuration data, formats each item based on whether 
it is selected or not, and adds it to the screen.
4. **main Function**: This is the main loop of the script. It continuously 
redraws the menu and handles keyboard input (up arrow, down arrow, Enter 
key) to navigate and select an item.

### 5.4 `ollamaautomodelsjsonconf.py`

**Summary:** Generates `add:ollama_models_gen.json` from installed Ollama models.

```python
# Ask ollama for it's full list of models: provide an example configuration file; if you want exactly
#   this list, rename the resulting ollama_models_gen.json into models_config.json, then run the model
#   selector to make one active default model selection into model_select.json. Then, run chat.py.

from Services.ollama_streamer import OllamaModelList
from Services.filename import filename

# Models is model list class
models = OllamaModelList()

# Models becomes it's output
models = models.models()

import json

# Data to be written as JSON
data = {
    "models": [
        
    ]
}

for m in models:
    data["models"].append({"localname": m["model"] + " with Ollama", "model": m["model"], "size": m["size"], "provider": "ollama", "internalprovider": "ollama", "stream": True})

# Open the model file and create an example for user, how to list all ollama's avaiable models.
with open(filename('ollama_models_gen.json'), 'w') as json_file:
    # Write data to the JSON file
    json.dump(data, json_file, indent=4)
```

---

## 6. Project Files — Service Scripts in `Services/`

### 6.1 `service.py`

**Summary:** Core abstraction for message history + backend selection.

```python
# Streamers basically stream the content from underlying AI, kind of token by token, and use
# python-convenient "yield" to pass the function output as if it was a stream. You catch this
# with "for" or "while" cycle, adding the string pieces together. "service.py" is a general
# streamer from which those specific streamers are deriven, so you mostly think you work with
# an AIService class instance as your server connection. This turns some typical uses into abstract
# terms and enables object oriented / imperative use.

class AIService:
    def __init__(self, parent=None):
        self.parent = parent
        self.messages = []

    # This gives all the indexed messages from parent Q&A until this one, in historic order of
    # creation of new messages.
    def inheritmessagelist(self):
        # Send all the messages of parent cue
        if self.parent != None:
            for msg in self.parent.inheritmessagelist():
                yield msg
        
        # Send all the messages for this request
        for msg in self.messages:
            yield msg

    def messagelist(self):
        # All the questions asked from the parents, with answers
        messages = list(self.inheritmessagelist())

        return messages

    # Message is registered either to list or dictionary of special positions
    #   "local" can be used to show the message only if it's part of the current Q&A, not if it's
    #   the history - I added this stub because there are several ways to implement this, but it's
    #   hard to understand context without placeholder. I removed more advanced functionality.
    def register_message(self, role, content, local = False):
        if content == None:
            return
        
        appendix = {"role": role, "content": content}

        self.messages.append(appendix)
    
    def asked(self, question, local = False):
        self.register_message("user", question, local)

    def answered(self, answer, local = False):
        self.register_message("assistant", answer, local)

    def commanded(self, answer, local = False):
        self.register_message("system", answer, local)
    
# TODO: here you need to register your models, to use the engironment variable, by their internal
#       provider: framework which is locally used.
#
# MAYDO: make Requirements.txt somehow depend on model selection, because these are large libraries,
#        and emulate Ollama's "run" behaviour to install model; altough this is not fully offline mode
#        and you can handle most of it by installer or packager, since hacker has at least some space
#        for non-production tools. I personally like offline mode and not depending on additional factor.

def initAIService(modelconf):
    # We must not call these imports from inside the initialization cycle, but this already
    # initializes an AI. We can not run litellm_streamer.py directly, for example, if we place
    # these imports into the header.

    # This is best connection to your local ollama interface, handling the specifics.
    if __name__ == "__main__" or "servicesrelative" not in globals(): servicesrelative = __name__ == "__main__"
    if servicesrelative: from ollama_streamer import OllamaBasicStreamer

    elif modelconf["internalprovider"] == "litgpt":
        environment = "litgpt"
        return LitGPTBasicStreamer(modelconf)
```

### 6.2 `filename.py`

**Summary:** Resolves config file paths by walking upward until `modelselector.py` is found.

```python
# This searches for configuration files; they are located where modelselector is first found, travelsing
# upwards: that is the main initialization script for configuration files and should be more resistent.

import os

# Because the filename depends on where we call the script from. It could be even more complicated for you.
def filename(namestring):
    # Start with the current directory and move up until the root directory is reached
    current_dir = os.getcwd()
    step_count = 0
    
    while True:
        # Check if the "modelselector.py" file exists in the current directory
        if os.path.exists(os.path.join(current_dir, "modelselector.py")):
            # If found, return the namestring prefixed with "../" based on the step count
            return '../' * step_count + namestring
        
        # Move up to the parent directory
        current_dir = os.path.dirname(current_dir)
        
        # Increment the step count
        step_count += 1
        
        # Break if we reach the root directory and still haven't found the file
        if current_dir == os.path.dirname(current_dir):
            break
    
    # If the file is not found, return namestring as-is (this part will probably yield an error)
    return namestring

# Example usage:
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # If it does not exist, error is handler in the caller: it handles it's own not-exist exceptions.
    namestring = "model_select.json"
    result = filename(namestring)
    print(result)  # This will print either "../path/to/example_file.txt" or just "example_file.txt" depending on the location of the script

    namestring = "models_config.json"
    result = filename(namestring)
    print(result)  # This will print either "../path/to/example_file.txt" or just "example_file.txt" depending on the location of the script
```

### 6.3 `ollama_streamer.py`
