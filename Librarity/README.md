# Library-like behaviour of this

"Library", in classical code, is mathematical equivalent to having a domain specific or general library in some specific format, index and content, applicable to particular problems in domain or general domain (general-purpose libraries, indeed, become rather paradigms than theories: like an operating system, they are not domain scope, but their paradigmatic difference becomes kind of "domain" simply because they differ; we can call this metadomains).

# Anarchy of text and code

When the programming library is structured dictatorship in modern use of the term, it used to convey a certain meaning.

In modern era, an official who simplified you into a number and set of fields, instead of having full documents of particular person in sense they can convey; from now on, they are not telling you any particular real-world constraints, but in constraint they can be very well systematized and legally even even if they look like anarchist to the old: rather, they use free-structured databases and text, and choose different fields to different applicant based on less formal rules. This, for now, is the future of education, where our typical official suddenly, in approaching years, would be a stagnant dictator only by "knowing" something clearly, what we decide by our will.

How this happens:
- **API**: rather than depending on single API, we do device some formal API protocols, but our users rely on API document in free form, with AI-generated details to fill what needs standardization.
  - Freedom: moves, from the point of supporting common interfaces, into the point where we *provide conversation examples* and *convey meaning of the API*.
  - We still provides examples and working drafts to single API, but 10-20 conversation documents between two APIs can allow them to be partially unique, creative expression rather than dictatorship of code.
- **Mathematics and code**:
  - We said "formal" if this was letter-by-letter encoded, much like machine code. Formalization ability in mathematics was the same, breaking the glass for every single symbol and it's look.
  - We will say "formal", when we have capable set of documents to decode any meaning and encode additions and changes in way by which capable AI can work.
  - We will not go into extreme with this: human processing of standardized documents creates dictatorlike, dumb official feeling, because general standards are impossible to create. Flexibility and freedom can be proven by work amount it takes to create exact schemas and standards: this is impossible. Yet, correct formulation, use of coherent terms and definitions does not come from programming or use of large databases, but has been the human need: we still need to create what we see as formal documents and code, but we can be more flexible.
- **Information containability**:
  - Actually, many small things in our text can convey meanings. Absolutely strict format can use mere subset of meanings, where we can meaningfully assign small changes and dispositions, extending our operator sets: for example two sentence ("sentence. sentence.") and variable inside a class ("class.variable") differ by space, but this is easier to meaningfully decode, than analyzing automatically by formal syntax: thus, we already have more symbolic sets and environments by little flex of our grammar.
  - We can create complex syntax for subtle meanings.
  - Rather than spending 10 years to create complete standard, we are more agile: we allow users to express their ideas in clear manner, create exceptions themselves, and while it's well-parsed over average, we slowly incorporate examples of those changes to make our tools aware. We can still resist them breaking the standard completely or creatively expressing things in another modular.
  - Look this list you are reading now: I somewhat break the standard and make it some-what freeform; by language and meaning it conveys, it's still definitely a list, and rather a simple list. It's not completely formal, altough.
