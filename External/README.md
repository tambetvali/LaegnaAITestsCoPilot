# External sources to learn about AI

For books, I have this bookslist, which is not complete list I reviewed, but rather shorter list of important books: [DevBooks](https://github.com/tambetvali/LaeArve/tree/main/Books/DevBooks) - notice while I did not read all the books; I studied them, I did read similar books, and I made this list which vaguely covers all the topics as you can find them from free books.

I used to read books and be happy for my introspection of creative mode; these days my Jungian personality type has adapted it's natural change of middle age, and indeed I am more sensibly extrovert in rather studying from video materials and involvement much more than observation.

Who are like me, born or become rather sensory extroverts than intellectual introverts, indeed find the video study sources as interesting as books.

Normally, this kind of planning is necessary:
- 1-5 minute videos allow to study the basics and advanced information several times, in full tracks, based on random interest.
  - Random interest, study of wider range of topics.
- 10-30 minutes videos is another common format, which often gives you the complete material.
  - Random interest, preparation of special time.
- 1-2 hours long video materials already need preparing, and you can use the short material before long, from the same provider, because the long video might need understanding of your progress.
  - While, for some of us, surprise and not knowing the end might matter, in neutral science we rather enjoy the boring ends and introductions, which already allow us to guess most of the material.
  - Having a template study from 1-2 hour video can mean it comes from more alerted and focused mood, while we might get tired in process of long video.
  - Time: clear interest, taking time for the topic.
- 3-6 hours: another source, which is equivalent to multiple 45 minute sessions which could fill a semester of this material if we get it once per week.
  - Time: special interest, allocation of whole day or weekend, preparation for work, interest or a hobby.
- 8-12 hours: this kind of source is often worth a whole university year, or even it'w whole representation of given material.
  - Special interest, which might fill a weekend with a work and actually needs attention and determination worth 2 working days; it gives us preparedness of a personal study and purposeful learning without missing a detail or an area.

Let's call those materials short, average or long, based on their length. Most providers provide you with each, but they do not provide alternatives inside the same class.

## Introduction / CoPilot

This section offers a clear orientation before diving into the practical recommendations. People approach AI learning with different temperaments, rhythms, and sensory preferences, and the variety of available material reflects that diversity. Some learners thrive on rapid exposure to many small concepts, while others prefer long, uninterrupted sessions that build a coherent mental model. Video‑based study has become a natural extension of modern learning styles, especially for those who find energy and clarity in sensory engagement rather than solitary abstraction. The length of a video often shapes the depth of attention it demands, and understanding this helps you choose the right format for your mood, schedule, and cognitive style. Short clips reinforce fundamentals and spark curiosity; medium‑length lessons deliver complete ideas in one sitting; long courses create immersion and continuity. Each format has its own strengths, and using them intentionally allows you to build both breadth and depth without losing motivation. This introduction frames the landscape so that the following chapters can be approached with confidence and a sense of structure.

# AI study materials in form of long videos

## Google

I did not study on google materials, but I think they have comprehensive list of clear and understandable, still advanced materials:
- I watched a few of them, which introduced decent innovations, but it has also good coverage of standard materials.

# We have several important providers

Here are the providers, who all provide with 1h, 6h and 12h classes or only the long class:
* Edureka: popular and does not take much background; I went through several of those - such as 1-hour, 3-hour and 12-hour course; not because of quality but as a matter of my selection.
  * Edureka has wide selection of courses and formats; the short and long course of same topic might overlap in material and allow for preparation and advanced repetition.
* Harvard CS50’s Artificial Intelligence with Python: this is definitely a quality, but you might get *somewhat* bored. Indeed, I did not reserve 3-4 weekends for this.
  * This is rather a single course by a man who looks like a hacker.
* Simplilearn - it's another style of Edureka-fashion of goal, which you might prefer based on your own preferences.
  * Some people might find it simpler than Edureka.
* Google
  * Advanced material coverage.
* MIT (Massachusetts Institute of Technology)
  * This is a provider of standard university-level education; the quality is very high but the format is rather boring, strict and follows classic education guidelines: but a teacher with classic classroom tools might inspire many, and sadly they mostly cover the most complete picture of things like equations and details, while lacking cineomatic presence.
  * Major technology universities all provide courses in roughly this format and avoid cineomatography; some of teacher might be better in drawing and sometimes, basic visuals are prepared to fill your mind with more-than-1000-words.

Okay I am highly visually mathematical, with high level of stimulation of visual representation with mathematical complexity. Selection of course can be based on several nuances about you and your determinant course of clarity:
- You can be visually-oriented thinker, who basically chooses between edureka (neutral to tech capacity), simplilearn (supports also very low tech capacity with still visually sound information of simplex draw) or pehaps Goodle; Harvard and MIT might become sensory underload for you.
- You might be auditory-oriented thinker, and prefer formats, standards and what is achieved by humans; in such case you want either Google, who succeeds again, or an University course.
- If you are good at mathematical algorithms and abstract thinking, visuals might become distraction and you want to see exactly the teacher in a classroom, and things he can draw with his hand or express by language, this means most people who do not rely on sensory intuitions.
- If you are a hacker, you want to see code and you can survive the given Harvard's course with a man who writes really a *lot* of efficient code.

You can see the courses come from these providers:
- Online course and free course specialized providers, who are good at visualization and neutral coverage of information.
- Universities and standard providers, who are good at "boringness" (this is kind of thing many people are inherently clinged to): they bring you through every boring detail and often stick to established standards of presentation; in most cases you can learn directly from the teacher - for example, it's hard to learn to be advanced visualization machine or audio device, so in case of popular providers you won't directly become yourself into what you see.
  - I was hyperactive personality in school, quite noticeably, and I get heavy sensory underload here: I tried, but sorrily I can look 10 hours of heavy audiovisual representation rather than explaining man with a few tools and abilities and tendency to speak slowly. I am sure not all people like hyperactivity - a tendency of either using all your abilities nonstop, excessively uneasy with being tired, and indeed being happy looking others who are using all their muscles and nerves.
  - As hyperactive person I am non-stop, and being rather intelligent and purposeful, I definitely like to watch people doing non-stop useful thing and keeping all their powers functioning and also doing all the other things and showing positive distraction to surrounding events, such as really involving a listener who just breaks in, and still achieving a main goal.
    - In modern science, indeed things like hyperactivity are need to be studied and used, integrated into your goals - young hyperactivists often do *useless* things non-stop.
    - Generally hyperactive person wants to see visuals and sound, and at older age they might get involved when they see physical movement to express an idea. This is actually an answer to many psychological profiles.
    - But remember I was *bad* at school. I highly respect these materials but here it's hard to stop several senses for 10 hours.
- Specialized technology companies
  - They can provide you visuals based on scientific needs and technological abilities: mostly it's rather the fact that a programmer can produce visual and interaction, than a fact of hiring hollywood-level of artistic designer; thus your sensory overload is heavy of organized mathematical and scientific representation rather than a "wow", rarely a "style".
  - They can be biased towards their own implementations and technologies, or they can introduce you your favourite provider and fulfill your client needs.
  - It's not the classic standard, but often a practical method, which can really do the thing: we are hackers, and we hack it together, so it's sometimes surprising from which materials you can do what.
- Hackers and programming enthusiasts, or informatics:
  - You get different representations, but mostly you are guided through particular task in detail basis, and might see handcrafted visuals on levels often meeting desires of the creator, but rarely a long flow of such visuals.
  - You heavily depend on your sympathy towards the specific person: they very often represent themselves and it's important whether you share the same preferrations or not, where you measure only a few abilities of a professional teacher.

# My own starting point

This was several years ago; I also have background of theoretical AI research as a child and a life-long interest and certanty that this will arrive at my age.

I watched several short introductions of 1 or 2 hours, and scanned through many.

Several of them were general-purpose and I wanted to have generic coverage of things I need to research; this is very probable that in future, I will watch more of them to keep generally informed and more extroverted in my attitude; I also went through specific crash courses of my interest:

[![Machine Learning Crash Course – Edureka](https://img.youtube.com/vi/b2q5OFtxm6A/hqdefault.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2q5OFtxm6A)

[![ChatGPT Crash Course – Edureka](https://img.youtube.com/vi/fBM0cFIMxaE/hqdefault.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBM0cFIMxaE)

It's not very probable that you learn any specific skills from that type of courses: but rather, you do not miss to cover things which are definitely covered at your age.

I prepared with 4 hour course in one evening:

[![Artificial Intelligence Full Course – Edureka](https://img.youtube.com/vi/JMUxmLyrhSk/hqdefault.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMUxmLyrhSk)

I went through the full course of that year in a weekend:

## Journey to the details

Coverage is important at very specific areas:

### 1. First term: ***scratch***.

You are interested in your specific detail ***from scratch*** in **X hours or minutes or seconds**, either visually, administratively, using libraries and toolsets or doing it entirely based on floating point numbers and basic math expressions in code.

You are probably going to find a man or woman like you, who does it your way.

I do not really know your way, whether you are auditory, visually or graph-and-language-based intelligent or alert and aware and doing man or woman; so I give you a video which qualifies as quite common markholder - the man is showing you the explanation, writing code, and he has turned into his most important advanced or intermediate points as well as basic facts into either visualization or graphically representative form. Most people would not have neither sensory overload \[you like music with small audience or you struggle with self-discipline\] or underload \[you like mainstream or pop music or you are hyperactive\] in any of these areas:

[![Neural Networks from Scratch – P.1](https://img.youtube.com/vi/Wo5dMEP_BbI/hqdefault.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo5dMEP_BbI)

### 2. You are also interested in ***mathematical visualization*** of particular things. Keywords: **animation**, **visual**, **simulation** experience.

Detail, speed and complexity of the visual heavily depends on particular level and domain or type of your intelligence, especially sensory intelligence, while very good representer can provide popular, general-public references:

[![Neural Network Demo Animation (Short)](https://img.youtube.com/vi/fQ376G-Ek1E/hqdefault.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/fQ376G-Ek1E)

This is longer course specialized on visualization, I personally would not die at that time, so you won't hear about me from these teachers (a normal, quiet listener):

[![A visual and intuitive understanding of deep learning](https://img.youtube.com/vi/Oqm9vsf_hvU/hqdefault.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oqm9vsf_hvU)

### 3. 5-second visuals of basic primitives

Okay this is where they hyperactive personality really comes in: the important, basic concepts is presented visually in 30-60 seconds. While a limited number of these is available at internet, the most important topics are covered.

You can find this kind of coverage on XOR (complex) and AND (simple) gates, as well as each particular area of complexity or necessity. Mostly, the visualizer cannot get ***much longer time of tightly packed information***, so ***anything longer than this is probably helping to avoid sensory overload or using other language for things where it lacks direct visual representation***.

Mathematically, it's rather complicated to visualize complex and necessary things each completely, in understandable fashion, and there are not many things, in a sense, to cover at all - we have some complex operations, a few different architectures, and a number of interesting details. Still, we lack a lot of this material.

[![Neural Networks 6: Solving XOR](https://img.youtube.com/vi/kNPGXgzxoHw/hqdefault.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kNPGXgzxoHw)

Altough there are more visual materials than the given video, it's a particularly clear operation or conception, which has been visually encoded into a detail so you can really make sure you are talking about this process.

## Full course program

You have courses at youtube for learning Python, libraries like PyTorch, and tools like LitGPT.

In each case you are interested in:
- Universities, who provide standard approach.
- Online courses, who are often more popular.
- Companies, who represent their tools or tools they use.
- People, like professionals, hackers or hobbyists, who go into particular details and present the tools in various applications or solutions.

You might be interested in finding similar courses in Quantum Physics, Chemistry, Mathematics and many scientific areas, which might be background for doing specific things with programming and AI, or general life background, or also areas of your other interests: generally, we need to be scientific people in decent world.

Life, spirituality, philosophy etc. is indeed available and might be your background seek.

## Broader Overviews, Tools, and Practical Learning Paths

### General‑Purpose Overviews
These survey‑style introductions help learners build a mental map of the AI landscape. They are ideal for strategic thinkers, planners, and anyone who prefers to understand the whole system before diving into details. Such overviews prevent blind spots and make later deep dives more coherent, though they may feel slow or abstract for fast‑paced or hyperactive learners.

### Practical, Tool‑Based Tutorials
Hands‑on tutorials resonate with people who learn by doing. These videos jump directly into code, tools, and workflows using Python, NumPy, TensorFlow, PyTorch, Scikit‑learn, Google Colab, Hugging Face, and modern LLM frameworks. They suit hyperactive learners, tinkerers, and visually logical thinkers who need immediate feedback. The strength of this style is rapid intuition‑building, though it can lead to fragmented understanding if not paired with conceptual grounding.

### Visualization‑Heavy Learning
Some learners grasp AI only when they see it. Animations, simulations, and graphical explanations make abstract concepts tangible. This style benefits sensory and spatial thinkers who prefer diagrams over long verbal explanations. It reduces cognitive load and accelerates intuition, though it may oversimplify deeper theory.

### Micro‑Bursts and 30‑Second Concepts
Short, high‑density clips—often 30 to 60 seconds—are perfect for hyperactive or high‑speed learners. They deliver tightly packed primitives such as XOR gates, activation functions, or architectural sketches. These bursts maintain momentum and help with memorization, though they rarely provide enough depth for full mastery.

### Deep‑Dive Mathematical or Theoretical Content
For analytic minds, mathematical derivations and theoretical explanations provide long‑term mastery. These videos explore optimization, matrix calculus, statistical learning, and model internals. They suit detail‑oriented learners who need to understand the “why” before the “how.” While powerful, this style is slow and demanding, and may overwhelm hyperactive learners without pacing.

### How These Styles Fit Together
A balanced learning journey draws from all categories. Broad overviews provide structure, practical tutorials build skills, visualizations create intuition, micro‑bursts maintain momentum, and theoretical deep dives fill conceptual gaps. By sampling across formats, speeds, and sensory modes, it becomes possible to avoid blind spots and develop a more complete understanding of AI.
