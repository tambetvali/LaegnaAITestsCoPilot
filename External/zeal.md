# Zeal

Zeal is a documentation browser with nice interface you can use easily at linux and with some effort on other platforms.

# Zeal

**CoPilot**:

Zeal is an offline documentation browser that provides fast, searchable access to a wide range of programming manuals. It is especially convenient on Linux, but also works on Windows and macOS with a bit of setup. For anyone working with programming languages, AI frameworks, or web technologies, Zeal offers a distraction‑free way to browse documentation without relying on an internet connection.

## How Zeal Supports the Tools Used in This Project

The tools and libraries referenced throughout this project span Python, AI/ML frameworks, logic programming, numerical computing, and web development. Zeal’s ecosystem of Dash‑compatible docsets covers a large portion of these technologies, making it a practical companion for readers who want quick access to documentation while experimenting or learning.

### ✔ Fully Supported Docsets

Zeal provides complete offline documentation for:

- **Python** (core language + standard library)
- **Flask**
- **NumPy**
- **scikit‑learn**
- **PyTorch**
- **MongoDB**
- **JSON**
- **Pygments**
- **Backbone.js**
- **SpaCy**
- **Julia**
- **CommonMark Markdown**

These docsets cover most of the tools listed in the project’s recommended environment.

### ✔ Partially Covered or Related Docsets

Some tools do not have direct docsets, but Zeal includes related documentation that supports their usage:

- **HuggingFace ecosystem** → Transformers + Tokenizers docsets exist  
- **Mistune** → Covered indirectly by Markdown + Python docs  
- **Genanki** → Python docs cover most usage patterns  
- **Anytree** → Python docs + tree‑structure libraries  
- **mpmath** → Direct docset available  
- **Markdown variants** → CommonMark + original Markdown references  

### ✖ Not Covered (Online Only)

These tools currently have no Zeal docsets:

- LitGPT  
- Ollama  
- DatSu  
- MdMath (as a specific tool)  

Even so, Zeal covers the foundational layers these tools depend on, making it useful even when direct docsets are unavailable.

## Why Zeal Is Useful for Readers

Readers working with the tools in this project will benefit from Zeal because it provides:

- **Instant access** to documentation while coding  
- **Offline availability**, useful in minimal or isolated environments  
- **Fast search** across multiple manuals at once  
- **Consistent interface** for browsing different technologies  
- **Reduced context switching**, keeping focus on experimentation and learning  

Whether someone is exploring Python, building small web services, experimenting with AI models, or learning logic programming, Zeal offers a unified documentation experience.
