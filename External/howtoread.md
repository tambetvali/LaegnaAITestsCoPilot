# General Reading Manual

## 1. Reading technical documents

When we read technical material, we don’t *immerse* ourselves in every sentence — we *use* it. Technical reading is functional rather than emotional.

- We depend on **formatting** and **syntax highlighting**; code is a formal language, and Markdown, code blocks, notebooks, or formatted docstrings help structure it.
- **Syntax highlighting** ensures we see *all information*, not a lossy or ambiguous representation.
- **Formatting** guides meaning:
  - **Bold** introduces concepts.
  - *Italic* reintroduces concepts, refers to standard thinking, or frames new conceptual structures.
- **Scanning** is the primary mode: icons, highlighted blocks, blockquotes, titles, and aligned layout help us navigate quickly.
- **Introductions and conclusions** are functional: they reveal the whole topic upfront and reduce the need for deep reading.
- We emphasize important information; mathematics and code are often less emphasized because experienced readers absorb them intuitively.
- Users follow their own interests and skip the rest.

## 2. Reading books

Books — especially large or reference‑style ones — are approached differently:

- We focus on **specific chapters** or **specific conceptions**, not the entire book.
- When reading many books on similar topics, we look for **the major points each one contributes**, since many chapters repeat across authors.
- We study the **structure** of a book first: its chapters, internal logic, and layout.
- Specialization is normal: some readers master only certain sections, while others spend weeks on a single page of formulas. Linear reading works only for certain people and situations.

## 3. Reading tutorials

Tutorial reading is pragmatic:

- We focus on **commands, tools, interfaces, and lists of considerations**.
- Sometimes we study code deeply, but often we simply **copy commands** after understanding the tool’s purpose.
- We skim headers, APIs, and highlighted sections, even if we don’t fully understand every optimization or trick.

## 4. A note on fiction

These principles apply to technical documents, documentation, and instructional material — not to fiction.

Fiction, poetry, and narrative writing are read differently:

- We let emotion build word by word.
- We avoid spoilers and do not seek the ending in advance.
- We read for the *experience*, not the structure.
- It’s closer to watching a film than using a tool.
