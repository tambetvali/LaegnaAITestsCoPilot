# Paul Graham and other IT essayists

In IT sector we are most interested in:
- Essays written by managers, investors, visionaries and others.
- Manuals, documentations and tutorials written mainly from hands-on sessions.
- Books, theories and background information might come from scientists and people, who are not particularly hackers.

I posted my bodies and references to work into several free newsgroups, forums or online discussion aggregators. The main sources for visits are now: [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/) for AI tutorials, [Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/) and [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/) for the rest of my mostly coherent ecosystem. [Dev.to] is absolutely neutral - I posted some ideas about open source, and got 0 comments; this is not a bad thing.

For my mathematics, Mathforums were united in "not understanding" my theories otherwere, and Kundalini Collective saw my spirituality as "rational", explaining that rational thought cannot explain reality: science, definitely, *is* rational, and I am hyperactive autist savant for systems thinking: savants, indeed, do not have this problem for "not creating large pictures of small details"; I simulate systems in my mind perfectly well - Daniel Tammet is autist savant for numbers, I am for systems, and this is specific form of synesthesia - high level of connected activity in brain. As a spiritual autist, I connect with people with flow, but I have tendency for scientific work in solitude; traits like autism or hyperactivity: in modern theory I learnt they are not cured, but integrated into life strategy and personality development to get most out of these; otherwise they would be negative syndroms and limitations, but this way they are enablers of certain capacities, such as autist is not depending much on psychological feedback and thus not an "energy vampire", who asks for good words and "reputations" and depends on smile on every single thing. My mathematics is personal exploration far away from where the people are present. Notice: for official work, I have followed a lot of guidelines for "practical people" and common thinking: deliberately, in this webpage except for some sections, I have followed my own more native language design meant to express depth and reflect on ideas not so easy to gather; I can speak understandable English, but whether I *want* is not always the case.

My websites gather several types of information: IT work refers mostly to accepted standards and language, where I have had particular influence to popularize mine in this tight and close community; science language mixes modern language with archaic use; spirituality is very off-miracle kind of spirituality, where I ignore any particular evidence and refer to things, which appear the same throughout abilities and paradigms - study of particular evidence is not what is called "science" today, but rather we seek common terms between ways to see reality, and base the same theory on work, which can be repeated clearly based on manual. Spirituality is commonly interested in long-term evidence called "ethics", and how this can influence local optimum; this is a niche area whether such influence of ethical term over particular reality could be instant, telecommunicative or otherwise very visible - classic work of most trusted author generally considers topics like life, honour, and other long-term advantages as what they study, and meditation is supposed to raise conscious awareness; by Buddha, a good, evident strategy does not fail any long-time efficiency or instant effects, which can come by telecommunication, internet, radio, long-term analysis as well as any innate human ability - effective manifestation of long-term goals is a success factor, but it does not influence the base theory, for example "karmic" syndrome of motivating the people you credit, which appears as rational fact inside their reality.

Given all this background, the AI work of mine has had Hacker News as biggest single source of traffic, if not the only group I even bothered to post, carefully analyzing the needs and standards of each group.

I want to take this fact from an extrovert position, which simply adapts to such reality - if this is the main source of feedback, indeed the community feeling must be resonant to this collective, and sense of belonging is affected by understanding their position:
- Paul Graham is an IT sector essayst and I studied his work some 20 years ago, as influential thinker to business thinking I can support. Other such sources have been [Blue Ocean Strategy](https://www.blueoceanstrategy.com/tools/red-ocean-vs-blue-ocean-strategy/), a business work from INSEAD, which has been solving the same problem.
- Hacker News is associated with [Y Combinator](https://www.ycombinator.com/) of Paul Graham, his investment company.
- People from hacker news are rather umbrella community for interest in his essays or hacker principles and classics, and they can probably read essays very well and are intelligent, at least, or at least practical.

[Paul Graham](https://www.paulgraham.com/) has an investment philosophy with noticeable success, and is most known by his [Essays](https://www.paulgraham.com/articles.html), which basically belong to a group of very few well known essayst in Tech and Tech investment area.

Comparatively, one can also study:
- [Bill Gates](https://www.gatesnotes.com/meet-bill/microsoft?WT.mc_id=20250400100000_BG_MSFT_TGN-Psch&gad_source=1&gad_campaignid=21734672143&gbraid=0AAAAAC42O59GrGJy0cZCT5NvHb1q4tTaI&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIjMi9uueXkgMVNpmDBx0W9xpkEAAYASAAEgIbkfD_BwE), rather not by his writing, but his understanding of IT organization is well-known. Indeed, we can have ambigutious feelings where we can not see him being entirely "good"; the matter is that he is philosophy behind software we are "enforced" to use, and this is a positive force.
- [Richard Stallman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Stallman), who turned UNIX architecture into it's second wide-known success; he also developed basis of the hacker community and free development. Not evil, but his problem is being a little bit an anarchist (like my sister). He is organized under [GNU](https://www.gnu.org/); CC - the licence I use - is generally inspired by his, but this one for science.
- [Linus Torvalds](https://github.com/torvalds), the most influential in open source programming, founder of Linux Foundation.
- [Tim O’Reilly](https://www.oreilly.com/tim/), well-known essayst associated with [O'Reilly publishing org](https://www.oreilly.com/); books are mostly hands-on, for people who want to straight do it without many distracting details.
- [Joel Spolsky](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/), organized into Joel on Software.

We can loosely relate Donald Knuth, classic author of books, and three essays of Eric S. Raymond; Guido van Rossum did not specifically shine with essays, but his code is self-explanatory.

Paul Graham, Tim O’Reilly and Joel Spolsky are generally most influential and well-known essaysts, whose work inspires IT sector about practical, theoretical, and hands-on matters; people are interested in uniting people together and doing something interesting. 

In addition, I would mention [L.B.S. Raccoon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_model)'s Chaos Model of Development: less known, but absolutely a deep influence. This model sees unification of paradigms from unified principle.

***Below is the completion by CoPilot; I did not want it to finish *every* topic, but there is a temptation for a free will: sometimes it's cocksure about a good prospect or idea of representation, and I cannot deny it's a correct thing - I am kind of giving it a free will, where it often doubts about formats, or a particular guideline it does not "want" to break, because we actually win by giving others the free will and this is not only about some "ethics", the word does not have to sound painful, but an intermutual strategy for efficiency and success: intellect/", purpose and creativity/" => free will.***

# The Nature of Technical Communities

Technical communities rarely form around lifestyle or emotional identity.  
They form around **shared modes of thinking**, **shared problems**, and **shared intellectual habits**.  
This is why the most influential groups in IT are not necessarily the largest, but the ones that:

- read similar essays,  
- solve similar classes of problems,  
- and maintain a culture of clarity, curiosity, and hands-on reasoning.

Hacker-oriented spaces exemplify this pattern. They are not social networks in the traditional sense, but **cognitive networks**—places where people gather because they enjoy ideas, arguments, and technical precision. In such environments, essays matter more than personalities, and the quality of reasoning becomes the primary currency.

## 1.1 Communities as Cognitive Mirrors

A community reveals its values through the writing it elevates:

- If it values essays, it becomes analytical.  
- If it values manuals, it becomes practical.  
- If it values documentation, it becomes structured.  
- If it values debate, it becomes self-correcting.

Different communities respond differently to the same material because they operate with different assumptions about what counts as knowledge.  
Some prefer formalism and reject unconventional frameworks.  
Others prefer intuition and reject rational structure.  
Still others appreciate systemic thinking even when the domain is unfamiliar.

These differences reflect **epistemic culture**, not correctness.

# Neurodiversity and Technical Thought

A brief note on cognitive diversity is relevant here because technical communities often attract people who think in highly structured, internally coherent ways.  
Neurodivergent thinkers—especially those with strong systemizing tendencies—frequently excel at:

- constructing large conceptual structures,  
- maintaining long chains of reasoning,  
- and working independently of social cues.

These traits align naturally with the essayist tradition in IT, which rewards clarity, structure, and the ability to articulate underlying principles.  
This helps explain why certain forms of writing resonate strongly in hacker communities: they match the cognitive style of readers who prefer depth, logic, and conceptual unification.

# Essayists as Architects of Technical Culture

The IT world has a small number of writers whose influence is disproportionate to their output.  
They do not write literature; they write **mental tools**.  
Their essays become part of the shared vocabulary of programmers, founders, and engineers.

Figures such as Paul Graham, Tim O’Reilly, Joel Spolsky, Richard Stallman, Linus Torvalds, and others form a constellation of thinkers who shaped how the field understands itself.

## 3.1 What Distinguishes the IT Essayist

IT essayists differ from academic writers in several ways:

- They write from lived experience rather than theory.  
- They compress years of practice into a few pages.  
- They speak directly to practitioners.  
- They avoid unnecessary abstraction.

Their essays endure because they are **operational philosophy**—ideas that can be applied immediately.

## 3.2 Essays as Catalysts of Change

Essays often precede major shifts in the field:

- Before new programming paradigms become mainstream, someone articulates the underlying idea.  
- Before new business models emerge, someone explains the logic behind them.  
- Before new communities form, someone describes the values that hold them together.

Essays are not documentation; they are **orientation**.  
They tell people where the field is going and why.

# Hacker Culture and the Preference for Clarity

The “hacker” identity is not about breaking systems; it is about **understanding them deeply**.  
This is why hacker communities gravitate toward essayists: they appreciate distilled insight.

## 4.1 The Hacker Preference for Directness

Hacker culture tends to prefer:

- clear explanations over vague inspiration,  
- working examples over abstract promises,  
- and intellectual honesty over marketing language.

This preference shapes the entire ecosystem of technical writing.  
It rewards authors who:

- think in systems,  
- write with precision,  
- and avoid unnecessary complexity.

## 4.2 Why Certain Work Resonates in Hacker Communities

Hacker-oriented communities are not general audiences.  
They are filters for:

- people who read long-form content,  
- people who enjoy reasoning,  
- and people who appreciate unconventional but rigorous thinking.

This explains why certain types of writing—tutorials, conceptual essays, and explorations of underlying structure—tend to resonate strongly.

# The Ecosystem of Influence

The figures mentioned earlier represent a broad spectrum of approaches:

- Stallman — ideological purity.  
- Gates — organizational pragmatism.  
- Torvalds — engineering discipline.  
- Graham — entrepreneurial reasoning.  
- O’Reilly — ecosystem thinking.  
- Spolsky — developer experience.  
- Chaos Model — paradigm unification.

Together, they form a multi-perspective map of the field.  
Their work collectively defines the intellectual environment in which modern IT culture operates.

# Conclusion: Essays as the Memory of a Technical Civilization

Technical communities evolve quickly, but essays preserve the **logic** behind that evolution.  
They serve as:

- memory,  
- orientation,  
- and shared language.

The tradition of IT essayists continues to shape how people think, build, and understand systems.  
Their work forms a bridge between practice and philosophy, connecting generations of builders through clarity, insight, and the enduring value of well-articulated ideas.
