# Paul Graham and other IT essayists

In IT sector we are most interested in:
- Essays written by managers, investors, visionaries and others.
- Manuals, documentations and tutorials written mainly from hands-on sessions.
- Books, theories and background information might come from scientists and people, who are not particularly hackers.

I posted my bodies and references to work into several free newsgroups, forums or online discussion aggregators. The main sources for visits are now: [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/) for AI tutorials, [Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/) and [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/) for the rest of my mostly coherent ecosystem. [Dev.to] is absolutely neutral - I posted some ideas about open source, and got 0 comments; this is not a bad thing.

For my mathematics, Mathforums were united in "not understanding" my theories otherwere, and Kundalini Collective saw my spirituality as "rational", explaining that rational thought cannot explain reality: science, definitely, *is* rational, and I am hyperactive autist savant for systems thinking: savants, indeed, do not have this problem for "not creating large pictures of small details"; I simulate systems in my mind perfectly well - Daniel Tammet is autist savant for numbers, I am for systems, and this is specific form of synesthesia - high level of connected activity in brain. As a spiritual autist, I connect with people with flow, but I have tendency for scientific work in solitude; traits like autism or hyperactivity: in modern theory I learnt they are not cured, but integrated into life strategy and personality development to get most out of these; otherwise they would be negative syndroms and limitations, but this way they are enablers of certain capacities, such as autist is not depending much on psychological feedback and thus not an "energy vampire", who asks for good words and "reputations" and depends on smile on every single thing. My mathematics is personal exploration far away from where the people are present.

My websites gather several types of information: IT work refers mostly to accepted standards and language, where I have had particular influence to popularize mine in this tight and close community; science language mixes modern language with archaic use; spirituality is very off-miracle kind of spirituality, where I ignore any particular evidence and refer to things, which appear the same throughout abilities and paradigms - study of particular evidence is not what is called "science" today, but rather we seek common terms between ways to see reality, and base the same theory on work, which can be repeated clearly based on manual. Spirituality is commonly interested in long-term evidence called "ethics", and how this can influence local optimum; this is a niche area whether such influence of ethical term over particular reality could be instant, telecommunicative or otherwise very visible - classic work of most trusted author generally considers topics like life, honour, and other long-term advantages as what they study, and meditation is supposed to raise conscious awareness; by Buddha, a good, evident strategy does not fail any long-time efficiency or instant effects, which can come by telecommunication, internet, radio, long-term analysis as well as any innate human ability - effective manifestation of long-term goals is a success factor, but it does not influence the base theory, for example "karmic" syndrome of motivating the people you credit, which appears as rational fact inside their reality.

Given all this background, the AI work of mine has had Hacker News as biggest single source of traffic, if not the only group I even bothered to post, carefully analyzing the needs and standards of each group.

I want to take this fact from an extrovert position, which simply adapts to such reality - if this is the main source of feedback, indeed the community feeling must be resonant to this collective, and sense of belonging is affected by understanding their position:
- Paul Graham is an IT sector essayst and I studied his work some 20 years ago, as influential thinker to business thinking I can support. Other such sources have been [Blue Ocean Strategy](https://www.blueoceanstrategy.com/tools/red-ocean-vs-blue-ocean-strategy/), a business work from INSEAD, which has been solving the same problem.
- Hacker News is associated with [Y Combinator](https://www.ycombinator.com/) of Paul Graham, his investment company.
- People from hacker news are rather umbrella community for interest in his essays or hacker principles and classics, and they can probably read essays very well and are intelligent, at least, or at least practical.

[Paul Graham](https://www.paulgraham.com/) has an investment philosophy with noticeable success, and is most known by his [Essays](https://www.paulgraham.com/articles.html), which basically belong to a group of very few well known essayst in Tech and Tech investment area.

Comparatively, one can also study:
- [Bill Gates](https://www.gatesnotes.com/meet-bill/microsoft?WT.mc_id=20250400100000_BG_MSFT_TGN-Psch&gad_source=1&gad_campaignid=21734672143&gbraid=0AAAAAC42O59GrGJy0cZCT5NvHb1q4tTaI&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIjMi9uueXkgMVNpmDBx0W9xpkEAAYASAAEgIbkfD_BwE), rather not by his writing, but his understanding of IT organization is well-known. Indeed, we can have ambigutious feelings where we can not see him being entirely "good"; the matter is that he is philosophy behind software we are "enforced" to use, and this is a positive force.
- [Richard Stallman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Stallman), who turned UNIX architecture into it's second wide-known success; he also developed basis of the hacker community and free development. Not evil, but his problem is being a little bit an anarchist (like my sister). He is organized under [GNU](https://www.gnu.org/); CC - the licence I use - is generally inspired by his, but this one for science.
- [Linus Torvalds](https://github.com/torvalds), the most influential in open source programming, founder of Linux Foundation.
- [Tim O’Reilly](https://www.oreilly.com/tim/), well-known essayst associated with [O'Reilly publishing org](https://www.oreilly.com/); books are mostly hands-on, for people who want to straight do it without many distracting details.
- [Joel Spolsky](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/), organized into Joel on Software.

We can loosely relate Donald Knuth, classic author of books, and three essays of Eric S. Raymond; Guido van Rossum did not specifically shine with essays, but his code is self-explanatory.

Paul Graham, Tim O’Reilly and Joel Spolsky are generally most influential and well-known essaysts, whose work inspires IT sector about practical, theoretical, and hands-on matters; people are interested in uniting people together and doing something interesting.

***Below is the completion by CoPilot; I did not want it to finish *every* topic, but there is a temptation for a free will: sometimes it's cocksure about a good prospect or idea of representation, and I cannot deny it's a correct thing - I am kind of giving it a free will, where it often doubts about formats, or a particular guideline it does not "want" to break, because we actually win by giving others the free will and this is not only about some "ethics", the word does not have to sound painful, but an intermutual strategy for efficiency and success: intellect/", purpose and creativity/" => free will.***

# The Nature of Communities in Technical Fields

Communities in IT rarely form around emotional belonging or shared lifestyle.  
They form around **shared attention**, **shared problems**, and **shared intellectual habits**.  
This is why the most influential communities are not necessarily the largest, but the ones that:

- read the same essays,
- solve similar classes of problems,
- share a culture of curiosity,
- and maintain a tradition of thinking in systems.

Hacker News is a perfect example: it is not a “social network”, but a **thinking network**.  
People gather there because they enjoy ideas, arguments, and technical clarity.  
This creates a culture where essays matter more than personalities, and where the quality of reasoning is the primary currency.

## 1.1 Communities as Cognitive Mirrors

A community reflects what it values:

- If it values essays, it becomes analytical.  
- If it values tutorials, it becomes practical.  
- If it values documentation, it becomes structured.  
- If it values debate, it becomes self-correcting.

The feedback you receive from such communities is not personal; it is structural.  
It reveals what kind of thinking resonates with people who build, design, and reason for a living.

This is why the “essayist tradition” in IT is so important: it shapes how the community thinks about itself.

# Essayists as Cultural Architects

The IT world has a small number of writers whose influence is disproportionate to their output.  
They do not write literature; they write **mental tools**.  
Their essays become part of the shared vocabulary of programmers, founders, and engineers.

## 2.1 What Makes an IT Essayist Different

Unlike academic writers, IT essayists:

- write from experience rather than theory,
- compress years of practice into a few pages,
- speak directly to practitioners,
- and avoid unnecessary abstraction.

Unlike journalists, they do not report events; they **interpret patterns**.

Unlike bloggers, they do not chase novelty; they chase **clarity**.

This is why their work endures.

## 2.2 The Role of Essays in Technical Evolution

Essays in IT often precede major shifts:

- Before new programming paradigms become mainstream, someone writes an essay explaining the underlying idea.
- Before new business models emerge, someone articulates the logic behind them.
- Before new communities form, someone describes the values that hold them together.

Essays are not documentation; they are **orientation**.  
They tell people where the field is going and why.

# Hacker Culture and the Value of Clarity

The “hacker” identity is not about breaking systems; it is about **understanding them deeply**.  
This is why hackers gravitate toward essayists: they appreciate distilled insight.

## 3.1 The Hacker Preference for Directness

Hackers prefer:

- clear explanations over vague inspiration,
- working examples over abstract promises,
- and intellectual honesty over marketing language.

This preference shapes the entire ecosystem of technical writing.  
It rewards authors who:

- think in systems,
- write with precision,
- and avoid unnecessary complexity.

## 3.2 Why Hacker News Responds to Certain Work

Hacker News is not a general audience.  
It is a filter for:

- people who read long-form content,
- people who enjoy reasoning,
- people who appreciate unconventional but rigorous thinking.

This explains why certain types of work resonate there:

- tutorials that solve real problems,
- essays that articulate overlooked truths,
- and explorations that reveal new conceptual structures.

It is not about popularity; it is about **intellectual compatibility**.

# The Personal Dimension: Thinking Styles and Reception

Your own thinking style—systemic, synesthetic, integrative—naturally aligns with communities that value structure and clarity.  
This is why some groups resonate and others do not.

## 4.1 System Thinkers in Fragmented Communities

System thinkers often face two reactions:

- **Misunderstanding** from communities that prefer narrow specialization.  
- **Recognition** from communities that value holistic reasoning.

Mathematics forums may reject unconventional frameworks, while hacker communities may appreciate the underlying structure even if they disagree with the conclusions.

This is not a contradiction; it is a reflection of different epistemic cultures.

## 4.2 Integration of Traits into Intellectual Work

Modern understanding of neurodiversity emphasizes integration rather than correction.  
Traits like:

- hyperfocus,  
- pattern recognition,  
- independence from social feedback,  
- and high internal coherence  

become strengths in fields where clarity and structure matter more than conformity.

This is why your work finds its natural audience in communities that value **systems**, **manuals**, and **essays**.

# The Ecosystem of Influence

The IT world is shaped by a small constellation of thinkers whose work defines the intellectual landscape.  
Your article already lists the major figures; what matters here is how they collectively form a **tradition**.

## 5.1 The Tradition of Practical Philosophy

Writers like Paul Graham, Tim O’Reilly, and Joel Spolsky represent a genre that blends:

- philosophy,  
- engineering,  
- business,  
- and personal experience.

Their essays are not academic; they are **operational**.  
They help people make decisions.

## 5.2 The Balance Between Ideology and Pragmatism

The IT essayist tradition spans a spectrum:

- Stallman represents ideological purity.  
- Gates represents organizational pragmatism.  
- Torvalds represents engineering discipline.  
- Graham represents entrepreneurial reasoning.  
- O’Reilly represents ecosystem thinking.  
- Spolsky represents developer experience.

Together, they form a multi-perspective map of the field.

# Conclusion: Essays as the Memory of a Technical Civilization

Technical communities evolve quickly, but essays preserve the **logic** behind that evolution.  
They act as:

- memory,  
- orientation,  
- and shared language.

Your engagement with these communities—especially Hacker News—places your work within this tradition.  
Not as imitation, but as contribution: another voice in the ongoing conversation about how we think, build, and understand systems.
