# Project/snippet introduction

For installation manual, open [TUTORIAL.md](TUTORIAL.md). This is free code, which will create you markdown-aware WYSIWYG editor, which still runs on HTML itself: it will convert the result to Markdown *after* you edit it, on server side.
- **Notice**: this is initial version and [we have to get through](TODO.md) parsing all tags, because code blocks are not yet parsed; headers, bold, italic - general formatting already works.
- It's Creative Commons free code for everybody; sensibly, I can easily give more rights for my code if you lack ones.

## 📚 Key Project Documentation

The Snippet1Editor includes three central documents that define how the project is structured, how to work with it, and what remains to be done. These are the primary entry points for anyone exploring or extending the system.

### 🔹 [STRUCTURE.md](STRUCTURE.md)
A high‑level architectural overview of the project.  
It explains:

- The folder layout and how components relate to each other  
- How the frontend, backend, and build pipeline interact  
- Where core logic lives and how data flows through the editor  
- How to extend or reorganize parts of the system safely  

Use this file when you want to understand *how everything fits together*.

---

### 🔹 [TODO.md](TODO.md)
A living development roadmap containing:

- Planned improvements  
- Known issues and technical debt  
- Refactoring targets  
- Feature ideas and experimental directions  

Check this file before contributing or planning new work.

---

### 🔹 [TUTORIAL.md](TUTORIAL.md)
A practical, step‑by‑step guide for using and modifying the Snippet1Editor.  
It covers:

- How to run the project  
- How the editor behaves in practice  
- How Markdown → HTML → highlighted Markdown flow works  
- Example workflows and usage tips  

This is the best starting point for new users who want to *learn by doing*.

# AI API — TipTap–Flask Markdown Workbench

This AI API defines the behaviour and structure of a **TipTap‑based WYSIWYG Markdown editor** embedded in a **Python Flask** application, using **Mistune** for Markdown parsing, **Pygments** for syntax highlighting, and **Backbone.js** for client‑side real‑time behaviour. The system follows a **model–view–controller (MVC)** paradigm and is designed so that the **API + Spec alone are sufficient for an AI to recreate or update the implementation**.

The application is a **single‑page workbench** served at the root path `/`, with:
- a **TipTap editor pane on the left** (WYSIWYG),
- a **rendered HTML preview pane on the right** (Mistune + HTML),
- a **visible intermediate Markdown pane below** (syntax highlighted with Pygments),
- and a **central “submit” button** (UTF‑8 arrow icon, styled via CSS, implemented as `<button>`).

The system supports:
- **round‑trip conversion**: TipTap HTML → Markdown (client) → Mistune HTML (server),
- **feature toggling** via a controller: enabling/disabling editor features,
- **content lifecycle**: user edits → submits → server responds with parsed content → right pane updates independently.

The AI must implement and maintain the following API surface and behaviours.

# Starting point: Getting Started With ChatGPT or Copilot

This project is intentionally small, transparent, and AI‑friendly.  
Whether you use a lightweight 3B model or a large model, the assistant can fully understand the codebase and help you extend it.  
You only need to give it the right starting context.

There are three simple ways to begin.

---

## A. Start by giving the AI the full STRUCTURE.md (recommended)

STRUCTURE.md contains the complete, working implementation of Snippet1Editor.  
It is short enough to copy in full and gives the AI everything it needs to understand:

- the architecture  
- the file layout  
- the Flask entry point  
- the WYSIWYG → Markdown flow  
- how input and output move through the system  

How to begin:

1. Open STRUCTURE.md in GitHub.  
2. Copy the entire file.  
3. Paste it into ChatGPT or Copilot.  
4. Add a message such as:

```
This is the full STRUCTURE.md of the Snippet1Editor project.  
Please read it and confirm you understand the architecture.  
We will continue working on this project together.
```

This gives the AI a complete mental model before you start modifying anything.

---

## B. Start from the task description in README.md (or your modified version)

If you prefer a guided introduction—setup, environment preparation, or conceptual overview—start with the high‑level description.

1. Copy the relevant part of README.md.  
2. Paste it into ChatGPT or Copilot.  
3. Add:

```
Use this description as the starting point.  
Help me follow the process described in TUTORIAL.md and set up the environment.
```

This mirrors the workflow shown in TUTORIAL.md, including the debugging and fixing steps in its second half.

---

## C. Start with the three tasks in TODO.md (jump straight into coding)

If you want to begin by implementing features, use the three initial tasks:

- HTML → Markdown processing for custom tags  
- Improving the WYSIWYG editor styling  
- Adding formatting buttons  

How to begin:

1. Open TODO.md.  
2. Copy the three tasks.  
3. Paste them into ChatGPT or Copilot with:

```
These are the first three tasks from TODO.md.  
Let’s pick one and start implementing it.  
Use STRUCTURE.md as the reference implementation.
```

This is the fastest way to start building.

---

## D. Ask the AI to add inference or customization

Once the AI understands the project (via A, B, or C), you can ask it to:

- add AI inference (Ollama, OpenAI, Copilot API, etc.)  
- turn the editor into a translator  
- turn it into a conversational interface  
- change the theme or layout  
- modify the WYSIWYG editor  
- add new modes or tools  

For example:

```
Now that you understand the project, help me add AI inference so the editor can act as a translator or conversational assistant.
```

Or:

```
Help me customize the design and improve the WYSIWYG editor.
```

The AI can generate new code, explain changes, and help you debug—just like the workflow demonstrated in TUTORIAL.md.

---

## E. What to do next

Once the AI is introduced to the project, you can ask it to:

- explain the architecture  
- implement one of the TODO tasks  
- add AI inference  
- customize the UI  
- debug errors  
- extend the project in any direction  

The project is intentionally linear and approachable, so both beginners and experienced developers can work comfortably with it.

## AI API — 3B Model

This subsection defines a **simplified but fully functional** version of the system, suitable for a ~3B parameter model. The focus is on **clarity, minimal dependencies, and straightforward logic**, while still respecting the overall architecture.

### 1. Routes and Endpoints

**1.1. `GET /` — Main Page**

- **Purpose:** Serve the main HTML page containing:
  - Left TipTap editor pane.
  - Right HTML preview pane.
  - Lower Markdown pane.
  - Central submit button.
- **Response:** A single HTML template with:
  - Linked JS/CSS for TipTap, Backbone.js, and custom logic.
  - Inline or linked CSS for layout (two columns + lower pane).
  - A small example Markdown snippet preloaded into the editor.

**1.2. `POST /parse` — Parse WYSIWYG Content**

- **Input:** JSON body:
  - `{"html": "<p>...</p>"}` — the current HTML content from TipTap.
- **Processing:**
  - Convert HTML to Markdown (simple, deterministic mapping).
  - Parse Markdown with Mistune to HTML.
  - Highlight Markdown using Pygments (server‑side).
- **Output:** JSON:
  - `{"markdown": "...", "html": "...", "highlighted_markdown": "..."}`

---

### 2. MVC Structure

**2.1. Model**

- Represents the **current document state**:
  - `raw_html` — last HTML from TipTap.
  - `markdown` — intermediate Markdown.
  - `rendered_html` — Mistune‑generated HTML.
- Stored in memory per request; no persistence required for the 3B version.

**2.2. View**

- Single HTML template with:
  - **Left pane:** TipTap editor container.
  - **Right pane:** `<div id="rendered-output">` for Mistune HTML.
  - **Lower pane:** `<pre><code id="markdown-output">` for Markdown (Pygments‑styled).
  - **Submit button:** `<button id="submit-button">` with UTF‑8 arrow icon.
- Layout:
  - Left and right panes share a common vertical height.
  - The **taller of the two** determines the height of the shared area.
  - The lower Markdown pane is always visible below, expanding as needed.

**2.3. Controller**

- JavaScript controller (Backbone.js) responsible for:
  - Initializing TipTap with a **Markdown‑like schema** (bold, italic, code, headings, lists, blockquotes, code blocks with language).
  - Providing methods:
    - `setMarkdown(markdownString)`
    - `getMarkdown()`
    - `enableFeature(featureName)`
    - `disableFeature(featureName)`
  - Handling:
    - Click on submit button:
      - Get current HTML from TipTap.
      - Send `POST /parse` with `{html: ...}`.
      - Clear editor content after sending.
    - Receiving server response:
      - Update right pane with `html`.
      - Update lower pane with `highlighted_markdown`.

---

### 3. Editor Behaviour

**3.1. Feature Set**

- Bold, italic, headings, inline code, code blocks with language, lists, blockquotes.
- Syntax highlighting in code blocks (client‑side or via CSS classes).
- Free‑form writing: no enforced structure beyond Markdown semantics.

**3.2. Height Synchronization**

- On each update:
  - Measure left and right pane heights.
  - Set both to the **max height**.
  - Allow the lower pane to expand naturally below.

---

## AI API — Full‑Fledged Model

This subsection defines an **extended, more robust version** suitable for a larger, more capable model. It adds **extensibility, configuration, and future‑proofing** while remaining compatible with the 3B version.

### 1. Extended Routes

**1.1. `GET /config` — Editor Configuration**

- Returns JSON describing:
  - Enabled features.
  - Default Markdown content.
  - Theme (CSS class names).
  - Any custom Markdown tags or extensions.

**1.2. `POST /parse` — Same as 3B, plus:**

- Optional fields:
  - `{"html": "...", "options": {...}}`
- Options may include:
  - `strict_mode` (boolean).
  - `extensions` (list of enabled Mistune extensions).
  - `highlight_style` (Pygments style name).

---

### 2. Extended MVC

**2.1. Model**

- May include:
  - Session‑based document states.
  - Versioning (simple history).
  - Optional persistence (e.g., in memory or lightweight DB).

**2.2. View**

- Supports:
  - Multiple themes (dark/light).
  - Optional toolbar customization (show/hide buttons).
  - Optional status bar (e.g., word count, mode indicator).

**2.3. Controller**

- Adds:
  - Dynamic feature toggling based on `/config`.
  - Ability to load/save content via additional endpoints (e.g., `/load`, `/save`).
  - Hooks for AI‑assisted transformations (e.g., “rewrite section,” “summarize,” etc.) — not implemented here but reserved in API.

---

# AI API Exp — Intent and Compatibility

The intent of this API is:

- To define a **stable contract** between:
  - The Flask backend,
  - The TipTap editor frontend,
  - The Markdown/HTML transformation pipeline.
- To ensure that:
  - **Any future implementation** that respects this API can be dropped in without breaking existing workflows.
  - **Code can be regenerated** by an AI using only this API + Spec, even if the original code files are lost.
- To support:
  - **Backwards compatibility**: new features must not break existing routes or change response formats in incompatible ways.
  - **Minimal coupling**: the editor, parser, and controller are loosely coupled via JSON and DOM contracts.

The 3B model version focuses on **simplicity and determinism**, while the full‑fledged version focuses on **extensibility and configurability**. Both share the same core API shape.

---

# AI Spec — Implementation Details

This section provides the **implementation‑level description** that an AI (or human) can follow to recreate the system.

---

## AI Spec — 3B Model

### 1. Flask Backend

**1.1. Dependencies**

- `Flask` — web framework.
- `Mistune` — Markdown parser.
- `Pygments` — syntax highlighting.
- `Pygments.formatters.HtmlFormatter` — HTML formatter for code.
- Standard Python libraries.

**1.2. `GET /` Implementation**

- Render a template `index.html` with:
  - A `<div id="editor"></div>` for TipTap.
  - A `<div id="rendered-output"></div>` for Mistune HTML.
  - A `<pre><code id="markdown-output"></code></pre>` for Markdown.
  - A `<button id="submit-button">➜</button>` (UTF‑8 arrow).
- Inject an example Markdown string into the page (e.g., via a `<script>` tag or data attribute) to initialize the editor.

**1.3. `POST /parse` Implementation**

- Read JSON body: `data = request.get_json()`.
- Extract `html = data["html"]`.
- Convert HTML to Markdown:
  - Use a simple, deterministic mapping (e.g., a small HTML→Markdown converter or a custom function).
  - Ensure only standard tags are used: `<p>`, `<strong>`, `<em>`, `<code>`, `<pre><code class="language-x">`, `<ul>`, `<ol>`, `<li>`, `<blockquote>`, `<h1>`–`<h6>`.
- Parse Markdown with Mistune:
  - `markdown_html = mistune.markdown(markdown_text)`.
- Highlight Markdown with Pygments:
  - Use `HtmlFormatter` with a basic style.
  - Wrap the Markdown in `<pre><code>` with appropriate classes.
- Return JSON with:
  - `markdown`
  - `html` (from Mistune)
  - `highlighted_markdown`

---

### 2. Frontend — TipTap + Backbone.js

**2.1. TipTap Initialization**

- Create a TipTap editor instance bound to `#editor`.
- Enable:
  - Bold, italic, headings, lists, blockquotes, code, code blocks with language.
- Configure TipTap to:
  - Use a schema that maps directly to standard HTML tags.
  - Provide a method to get current HTML: `editor.getHTML()`.

**2.2. Backbone.js Controller**

- Define a Backbone view or controller that:
  - Binds to the main container.
  - On `click` of `#submit-button`:
    - Reads HTML from TipTap.
    - Sends `POST /parse` with JSON body.
    - Clears the editor content.
  - On server response:
    - Updates `#rendered-output` with `response.html`.
    - Updates `#markdown-output` with `response.highlighted_markdown`.
  - On each update:
    - Measures heights of left and right panes.
    - Sets both to the maximum height.

---

## AI Spec — Full‑Fledged Model

The full‑fledged model extends the 3B implementation with more structure and configurability.

### 1. Configuration

**1.1. `/config` Endpoint**

- Returns JSON like:
  ```json
  {
    "features": ["bold", "italic", "heading", "code", "code_block", "list", "blockquote"],
    "default_markdown": "# Hello\n\nThis is an example.",
    "theme": "light",
    "custom_tags": [],
    "highlight_style": "default"
  }
