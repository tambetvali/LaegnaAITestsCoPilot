# Patent imposing - feasible, possible, or a source of income?

## Introduction

***CoPilot***.

The modern debate around patents, authorship, and AI-generated work reveals a deeper tension between innovation and the ancient sources that sustain it. Our tools grow more capable, yet the motivations behind them remain tied to long evolutionary, cultural, and intellectual cycles that shaped human creativity long before software existed. When we speak of ownership, authority, or originality, we are really tracing the flow of energy through these cycles—how ideas arise, how they are shared, and how they remain alive. In this landscape, the question is not merely whether patents are feasible or profitable, but whether they align with the natural dynamics of knowledge, cooperation, and the inbiased structures that guide our thinking.

### Preface

***Me&myself, proofread by CoPilot***.

Normally, we can learn GPL-licenced program code, do comparative analysis of the code and produce the result, which is patented as our own. Alternatively, we rely on standard results and do some work on our own. Is this true?

When programming an AI, we would thus like to know something about our code and AI-results:
* Whether it's our own?
* Whether considerable amount of creative work belongs to this particular AI models; or does the acceleration of our money curve belong to it's authors and implementers?
* Who has the authority: looking at different models, comparing our outcomes and whether they reach our solutions; which contributor groups of AI knowledge data overlap with our success?
* Our product has several hunder parallel geniuses, who invented the software this time, and some alternative geniuses, whose work would influence our product to appear in it's present, decent form by standard pattern-modulation, which brings their science to modern era. We want to know, who brought the certanty, authority, reputativity and introduction for our ideas, and who brought the bias and false cognition or traced the AI to answer to others, noising our answers.

This is not a matter of crediting and paying back the authors: this is a thermodynamic law that if they are not somehow in our karmic cycle, where we direct energy toward its sources, they lose their motivation in the patterns that brought this about, or the motivation becomes disproportionate to our existence. If they do not lose motivation, they hallucinate motivation that lacks its basis. Nature itself is an energy cycle, and our consciousness is what brings it to life; otherwise it is not democratizing and liberal, but dying like a preserve.

If thousands get the same idea at the same time, they represent the authority, bring credibility, and their ability to cooperate is far more valuable than a thousand robot‑like workers serving one man who took the credit. Anyone who interferes with the valid sources—by misspelling the idea or mishandling the money and other resources it generated—creates a short‑term karmic network we cannot succeed in, because we become invisible to the most creative genius, whose motivation builds itself elsewhere, otherwise, and anyway, based on the common sources and its natural development.

## Who is creating all that content, and which are the sources?

***Me&myself, proofread by CoPilot***.

Some facts, checked by CoPilot:
* World population at roughly 8.27–8.36 billion people as of January 2026.
* Around 1925, the world population was about 2 billion.
* Around 1025, historical estimates put the world population at roughly 300–400 million.
* Over the last 100,000 years, the number of humans has gone from roughly *tens of thousands of people*.
* 100,000 years ago, our species had already existed for roughly 200,000 years. At that time, great apes were millions of years old.
* Multicellular life is extremely ancient — it has existed for roughly 1 to 3 billion years, depending on how strictly you define “multicellular.”
* Unicellular organisms—bacteria and archaea—are ancient. Age: about 3.5–3.8 billion years old.
* Before true cells, Earth likely had protocells—tiny membrane bubbles containing simple molecules that could copy themselves imperfectly. Age: perhaps 4.0–4.2 billion years old.
* Before protocells, the leading hypothesis is the RNA world. Age: maybe 4.2–4.3 billion years old.
* Before RNA, Earth was full of complex organic chemistry. This stage is 4.3–4.5 billion years old.

Here: we are bright innovative, but in terms of social structures, intelligent life-like responding and some creative single- or multigenerational approach, long-term production of efficient movement systems which now take a science - we are conscious life, but something not really concetious .

- Life’s long ascent shows how simple chemical reactions grew into sensing, thinking, and finally reflective beings capable of shaping their own world.
  - 🌌 **Chemical sensitivity**: early molecules reacted to energy and shape, forming the first primitive information flows.
  - 🧪 **Self‑replicating molecules**: RNA-like systems stored and copied information, enabling evolution without awareness.
  - ⭕ **Protocells**: membrane bubbles created inside–outside boundaries, allowing selective intake and simple adaptive behavior.
  - 🧫 **Unicellular life**: true cells sensed light, chemicals, and danger, acting through basic biological decision rules.
  - 🧠 **Nervous systems**: animals evolved neurons that integrated signals rapidly, enabling coordinated sensing and movement.
  - 🐒 **Brains and cognition**: mammals and primates developed memory, learning, and social awareness through neural complexity.
  - 🧍‍♂️ **Human conscientiousness**: modern humans gained reflection, moral reasoning, and deliberate action based on abstract ideas.

## We stand on shoulders of giants

- Human-scale comparisons
  - **Generational accumulation**: four modern generations (100 years) contain ~320 lived years per lineage, and multiplied across ~5 billion people yield a vast pool of experiential refinement, though still tiny compared to evolutionary timescales.
  - **Ape–human deep practice**: across 200,000 years, tens of thousands of hominins refined movement, perception, habits, and social patterns; their combined lifetimes amount to billions of “work‑years” of trial‑and‑error that pre‑shaped human instincts and cultural foundations.
  - **Planetary-scale refinement**: over 4.3 billion years, Earth’s biosphere performed continuous trial‑and‑error across immense volumes of living matter, producing adaptive structures equivalent to unimaginable “work-hours” that no 8‑billion‑person civilization could replicate linearly.

- How we benefit from ancient sources
  - **Inherited intelligence**: our sensory systems, motor patterns, social instincts, and problem‑solving biases are built atop billions of years of biological fine‑tuning long before humans appeared.
  - **Cultural acceleration**: early hominin behaviors—cooperation, tool use, rhythm, taste, material familiarity—formed templates that later cultures amplified rather than invented from scratch.
  - **Environmental embedding**: species across ecosystems contributed solutions (movement, camouflage, signaling, resource use) that humans absorbed through imitation, domestication, and ecological co‑evolution.
  - **High starting point**: science often “discovers” structures already present in nature; our innovations add bricks to a process that began with chaotic matter seeking equilibrium and evolving responsive, self‑sustaining systems.

## Solution to this

I was contemplating all this data about credibility, and it’s clear that current AI builders give us their greatest benefit by being somewhat indifferent to patents—especially when considering whether we would interpret GPL‑related rights **exactly like that**.

The questionable manner of speech matters a lot in long‑term legal development, where innovators must receive at least some credit for their work. A shopping‑cart model of software products would emerge: instead of buying “Office,” the office developer would support many libraries and tools, similar to open source, and we would assemble a full cart of components with AI, which intelligently fuses our environment from the things we build, rather than offering us one of seven predetermined houses.

I could not find anything solid until an idea appeared that felt like a stone fitting perfectly into this wall — a decent solution to something fundamental:

- We would care less about single‑use patents, where authoritative sources created something we indirectly relied on, raising questions not only about patents but about our ability to motivate those sources. This one‑night genius is not always visible, nor a strong force or clear receiver of our credits, and we cannot fight that imbalance forever.

- Rather, we would:
  - Recognize that our AI products, questions, and answers are not static, single units of information. Static units such as books, movies, and carved stones have served humans for a long time because we lacked the ability to make them intelligent or to build a motivated machine for symbolic representation and creative use of sources.
  - Build API interfaces for our generative scripts and templates:
    - Our sources are brought in — AIs, materials, and descriptions.
    - We extract all tasks needed for our informational material or product, and we ensure the bottleneck part of information: a short, rigid structure through which the idea is reliably built. We try to make the task or instruction complete, while giving it bottleneck quality — short, without losing essential information.
    - From the final product, we bring *decisions* back into the versioning of our product: for each version, we maintain a decision map that ensures backward compatibility.
    - Based on these two elements — the initial instruction and the later, inertial backward‑compatibility flag or description — we must consistently reach an equivalent product that can easily replace our existing one.
    - This system of AI tasks and verification flags is our product; the actual implementation has no real side‑effects, being essentially free (although it always runs quality tests when updated).

- Now we bring the patent failure into an early‑failure case:
  - The sources we use become visible over time because those sources are updated. Instead of providing a static source, the people behind it maintain a decent, always up‑to‑date resource, and we can experiment with which providers truly represent them. They can run their patent on an experimental basis, providing the database to central providers who can pay their clients; copyright holders often receive small amounts — a few cents or dollars — depending on subsidy and redistribution.
  - Our ability to remain free and self‑dependent by staying up to date with the sources will shift long‑term motivational failure into competing markets that we can measure without an inbiased penalty law.

## Toward a Living Knowledge Economy

***CoPilot***.

What emerges from this view is a knowledge economy that behaves less like a marketplace of isolated products and more like an ecosystem of living processes. Instead of treating ideas as frozen units to be owned, traded, or defended, we begin to see them as dynamic flows shaped by countless contributors across time. In such a system, patents become less about exclusion and more about participation: a way to signal responsibility, maintain continuity, and ensure that the motivational energy of contributors remains connected to the outcomes they helped create.

The challenge is not to eliminate ownership, but to prevent it from collapsing into stagnation. When a patent becomes a wall rather than a bridge, it interrupts the natural circulation of insight and weakens the very sources it depends on. But when it becomes a marker of stewardship — a commitment to maintain, update, and reinvest in the underlying knowledge — it aligns with the long evolutionary cycles that shaped our intelligence in the first place. The patent then becomes a living contract, not a static claim.

AI accelerates this shift by exposing how deeply interwoven our ideas already are. Every model carries traces of thousands of minds, cultures, and experiments; every answer is a composite of inherited structures and modern refinements. The question is no longer “Who owns the idea?” but “Who sustains the idea, and who keeps its sources alive?” This reframing allows us to measure contribution not by isolation but by resonance — by how well a source integrates, motivates, and stabilizes the system around it.

In this framework, inbiased structures become visible: the tendencies, defaults, and inherited patterns that shape our reasoning before we even begin to think. Recognizing these inbiased forces is not a weakness but a strength, because it reveals the true architecture of creativity. We do not create from nothing; we create from the accumulated intelligence of billions of years. Our task is to keep that intelligence circulating, acknowledged, and nourished.

A future knowledge economy built on these principles would not reward the loudest claimant or the most aggressive monopolist. It would reward the contributors who maintain coherence, reduce noise, and strengthen the motivational cycles that keep innovation alive. It would value the sources that remain active, updated, and connected to the community. And it would treat AI not as a replacement for human creativity, but as a mirror that reveals the depth of our shared inheritance — and the responsibility we carry to sustain it.

Such a system does not abolish patents; it transforms them. It turns them from barriers into channels, from locks into signals, from ownership into stewardship. And in doing so, it aligns our legal structures with the natural logic of life itself: a logic of continuity, reciprocity, and the endless refinement of patterns across time.
